B06ZZ8Y89F,K. Eshed,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Feb,2018,I tested this with the included Li-ion cells and with a pair of AA Energizer LiMH rechargeables and it worked perfectly for both pairs.  (Life tip: DON'T try to recharge Energizer lithium batteries in ANY charger unless the batteries are specifically labeled as RECHARGEABLE. They will explode.)This charger also has an unexpected capability built in.  It can function as a battery pack to recharge your USB devices.  I don't think I will ever use this feature but I tested it anyway with the included cells.  It works well but one little nit I had with it was that only the left battery slot provides power.  When that battery was depleted I had to switch the right one to the left slot to continue charging.  I don't know if this is unique to the device I have or if it is in the design for the product.  I considered dropping half a star from my review for it but Amazon doesn't do half-stars and I can't drop a full star for a novelty feature that I will never actually use.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,TheGeekyCustomer,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-Feb,2018,This is a different take on the drab charger for the rechargeable batteries.PROS -1. Better LED Display allowing for much better understanding of Charge level as well as battery conditioning.2. Acts as a Powerbank in a pinch.3. Smart Selection of Charging mode. Think of Rapid charging for batteries.4. Avoids OverchargingCONS -1. Only two batteries can be charged at a time.2. There's no wall Plug included.Essentially this is a charger for two  AA AAA AAAA or C batteries. Unlike traditional chargers which feature a built in wall plug this item has a wire with a USB to MicroUSB conversion. Under normal usage it will be plugged into wall via a USB charger plug (Not Included). In a pinch you could plug the USB end of the wire into the full USB port on the device and plug the microusb end into your phone. In such a case you will be required to put in two C Rechargeable batteries included.Similar to Qi Rapid chargers for android phones (Lightning chargers for iPhone) this device determines charging current based on charge left on the batteries. This is rather innovative and reduces the charge times. There's also a Conditioning Mode which can resuscitate dying rechargeable batteries. Mind you I have not tested that part as yet.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,CHRIS DEMEO,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-Jul,2018,both two works great,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Cerberus,4.0 out of 5 stars,8-Sep,2018,This multi-type battery recharger charges two rechargeable batteries (Li-Ion NiCad etc.) of AA or AAA size or 18650 size using spring-loaded battery holders.  The charger has circuitry to detect the battery type to avoid overcharging which is very important to prevent battery case rupture or combustion.  In addition the charge has battery charge completion indicators (using blue LEDs) for each battery to enable the user to visually see the status of the charging process.  This charger is designed to be powered from a 5 vdc USB port on a PC or Mac.  Another interesting feature is that the charger with charged batteries can be used as a battery extender; i.e. it can charge other devices plugged into it after being removed from the USB power source.  The build quality is sufficient for its intended home-use design and for that reason I give it four stars.  A fifth star would be possible with a more robust design.  The charger unit cannot be plugged into a 110 VAC wall outlet; just the 5vdc USB power source.I purchased the charger with two 18650 style batteries that I use for my work flashlight.  So far the batteries seem to be acceptable but I've only charged them once so far and their lifespan in terms of number of charge cycles has yet to be verified.  The batteries are rated at 3200mAH each which is typical for this style.  Beware of any current technology 18650 battery on the market that claims higher charge capacity than 3200 mAH.  Fortunately the two batteries that came with the Victagen charger seem to be labeled honestly.  For these reasons I recommend the Victagen charger with two 18650 3200 MAH batteries.  Check the price but the old adage you get what you pay for is true here too.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Everstar,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-Jul,2018,So I have a bunch of lithium ion chargers and a couple nimh/nicd chargers in my office. I didn't even think of looking for something like this but then stumbled on it while browsing Amazon. This charges lithium ion (of all sizes) and my nimh and nicd! There's a mode that displays that - indeed - it has detected the type of battery in the slot. You can change the current charge rate from 1A to .5A and one of the neatest features you can use this as a mobile device battery backup with a cell in the first slot. The LEDs show what the charge is at on each cell.Definitely worth it!,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Brad holder,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Mar,2018,Great product very cool that it allows for charging different types of batteries at the same time. Added bonus with the power pack capability. Another perk you don't have to program it!,

B06ZZ8Y89F,Walkingdad_88,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-May,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,OldPhart4u,4.0 out of 5 stars,11-Aug,2018,This is a fairly simple dual bay charger that has been working well for a few days.  I bought it to replace an old Xtar VC2 I use in my tractor trailer to charge batteries for my vape devices.  The victagen is slightly smaller and lighter than the VC2.  (I use these on a magnetic phone mount attached to the dash)  I've charged 18650 and 26650 batteries with no problems.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,tg,4.0 out of 5 stars,9-Aug,2018,This product does good job overall.  the only complain I have is very typical with most chinese made products.  It is the cable.  The receptacle and over mold is always poorly made structurally mechanically and material.  During insertion is always little rough.  It's almost like the fitting isn't done correctly.  Classic bad tooling which cause the connector to have poor fitting.  Over molding materials and design is poorly done.  It still works one just have to be careful when handling the cable part of the device.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Jake,4.0 out of 5 stars,26-Mar,2018,Victagen 18650 Batteries (two) and universal charger -- both 18650 batteries were about 50% charged and approximately one hour to achieve a full charge via USB cable from my laptop.  The universal charger displays easy to read charging status and can adapt to accept double or triple A rechargeable batteries.Seems to be well built and will give it a 5 star after a few more charging cycles.  Thank you!,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Jeff Konkus,5.0 out of 5 stars,2-May,2018,It is a great charger.  Fast and intuitive.  The batteries did not fit my device that came with a 18650 battery.  I returned the product as I could not use the batteries....That was my first post with a 3starAfter further review of the batteries they have been covered with a rather thick shrink wrap for brandingwhen this cover was removed the batteries fit my device they are wicked strong batteries.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Luis,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-Jun,2018,Best charger ive seen and used. Pop in the batteires and it tells you what percentage it has. Simple to use interface means honestly no screw ups (im looking at you steve). Plug into a cellphone chsrger with micro usb cable amd your set. Put the batteries in wrong and no blinking lights which means wrong direction. Plus for those forgetful nancies it wont overcharge the batteries as well.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Karthik Padmanabhan,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-Feb,2018,I use this usually to charge the batteries for my Xbox Controller but last weekend I was traveling to Mexico and used this as a phone charger as well! It also avoids over charging and I use it on rotation with a pair of Eneloops I had purchased previously and it works well with that too. highly recommended!,
B06ZZ8Y89F,D. R. Edmonds,5.0 out of 5 stars,27-Mar,2018,Charges fast and it's easy to connect to any USB charger or specialized outlet. Haven't had a chance yet to test the life of the battery in the flashlight it's in but it definitely is brighter with this battery vs. regular ones.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Marcieanne,4.0 out of 5 stars,12-Sep,2018,It's nice to charge a few batteries at once and have feedback on the progress. Having 4 of the tactical flashlights the 2 batteries were an add plus. You can also put the batteries in the charger and use it as a battery bank to charge a phone etc. My other rechargeable fit too so I'm planning on ordering another one before winter. For the price you can't go wrong.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,fasteddiexx1,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-Aug,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Steven J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jul,2018,This is a great little charger. The fact that I got 2 3200mAh batteries with it is an unmatched deal. I was supprised at how fast it charged. It blew my Nitecore D2 away. The batteries fit a little wobbley but have no problems and I have charged up to a 26650 no problems. So far so good and I'm picky.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Frustrated in Indiana,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Aug,2018,Though I have not had the chance to wear down one of the batteries I am happy that it not only charges the ones inclueded but will also charge the rechargeable AAAAA batteries that I use on other things and it just hooks up to a charger I already have or my computer.  Nice options!,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Nicholas Cheok,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Aug,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,C. Chung,5.0 out of 5 stars,5-Jul,2018,Works great.  Having a USB connected charger works well with all of the other charging devices that use USB power adaptors.  I'm using mine with a charging station.  I'm using with this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XQ139DN/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1,
B06ZZ8Y89F,balconio,4.0 out of 5 stars,21-Sep,2018,I have cheap 18650 chargers (the kind that come with flashlights) and they don't inspire confidence. I know this charger will shut off when it hits 4.2v and that peace of mind is worth $15. Plus I can see the state of the charge in 25% increments which is neat.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Kevin Gaston,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Jul,2018,These batteries and charger are a lifesaver! It keeps batteries charged while being plugged into a laptop! The batteries are also 3200 mah which means they last a good amount of time before needing recharged! The charger automatically switches to the most appropriate charging amperage but can be manually over ridden.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,shrimpy,5.0 out of 5 stars,3-Feb,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Amazon lover,4.0 out of 5 stars,12-Apr,2018,So far so good. Batteries charged quickly and seem to work fine. I will see how they hold up.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Will C,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-Oct,2018,I originally bought this for my vape mod. I found out later that I needed flat top batteries to make it easier to remove and reinstall the batteries after charging. But these work perfect for my flashlight and the charger also works great for the lg flattop 18650 batteries I bought.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Jimmy K,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Aug,2018,This charger is packed with handy features.  Works well. Good service from  Victagen.  Socket for USB mini worked loose inside charger and stopped working after 2-3 months - they replaced it.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Jonathan Luna,5.0 out of 5 stars,10-Feb,2018,Very reasonable price for 2 batteries and one charger. The charger can also be used as a power bank when a charged battery in on the left hand side slot. There are two USB sockets on the top of the charger 1 micro USB female for charging the batteries and one USB-A female socket that is for the power bank mode.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,joshldyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Apr,2018,Seems like a quality product is a little weird that the batteries were in the charger when they opened it the batteries are not for Vaping they are the Round Top positive poles not the flat top.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,M. Krueger,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-Jul,2018,Bought these for an LED flashlight whose rechargeable batteries didn't last long. So far so good will update review with prolonged use details.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Quinn M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,29-Apr,2018,Great charger these batteries didn't fit in my box mod but that's probably me not reading. Batteries do sometimes get launched out of the charger if you bump it.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Dina Mary Zaky,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-May,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,charlie badger,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-Aug,2018,Liked bot the compactness of charger and ability to charge from computer and environmentally sound reuse of batteries.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,John Walker,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-Jun,2018,I bought this charger not only for the features but because it came with batteries for my new Innokin iTaste SVD.  They fit and work great as does the charger.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,DJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,26-Apr,2018,Charges fast and mostly evenly compared to another charger that only charges 1 battery to full and another to half. I just wish there was an option to get flat top batteries rather than what comes with it. If you are looking for the batteries with that little nipple at the top than this is a 5/5.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Jared Disler,5.0 out of 5 stars,26-Jul,2018,I needed a charger for the 18 650 battery including two more batteries it's good to have more,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Patrick Casto,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Jul,2018,Very nice charger. Wish it had discharge and recharge settings. Buy the 5vdc Wall wart.,

B06ZZ8Y89F,S. MOHADES,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-May,2018,Charged the batteries and they lasted longer than my old batteries that I've been using for about a year an I was pleased (not surprised) . I also like the USB port port on the side that can be used to charge other devices,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Doug P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,23-Apr,2018,It was a total surprise for me to find out that some of the batteries that I thought were bad just needed a charger like this one I have been able to recover 7 batteries(18650)from the trashed bin I had. Great buy,
B06ZZ8Y89F,T. K. Eads,5.0 out of 5 stars,10-Aug,2018,Use in my Atomic Beam Headlight and they work great!  One battery lasts all day at work and recharges in the truck.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Shangri-La project,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-Jul,2018,Works great and was a fantastic deal with the two batteries that it came with.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,joe self,5.0 out of 5 stars,26-Sep,2018,It a good charger I just wish I know the ETA charger time from dead to full  it other than that I'm able to get my batteries charged,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Marc Myers,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Jul,2018,This charger is great. Charges fast and works well. No complaints here.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,JC,4.0 out of 5 stars,7-Feb,2018,Charger works great and the batteries last. Only issue I had was they were to fat to fit into my fenix flashlight. It looks like they got generic 18650 batteries and added their own label. After I peaked off the plastic heat shrank label if fit and worked fine.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,AmazonShopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,6-Apr,2018,Excellent charger. I was surprised at first that it charges via USB but that makes for a fast charge. Also terrific to be able to charge many different sizes of batteries with a single charger. Highly recommend.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Mr Outdoors,5.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jun,2018,Works great. I have it plugged into a laptop and works perfectly,

B06ZZ8Y89F,Ginger M Hernandez,4.0 out of 5 stars,26-Apr,2018,Had product in three days. Product was easy to use. Clear indicators let you know when it's charged when it needs to be charged. I am very happy so far withe the product.,

B06ZZ8Y89F,Alan and Anne-Guri,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Aug,2018,Works nicely good to see battery levels only drwbk is not directly able to be plugged into outlet. If to be used as portable power needs a cover to keep batteries in charger,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Robert,5.0 out of 5 stars,15-Mar,2018,The batteries last a long time in my Atomic Beam flashlight and the charger charges all my AA  AAA and 18650 rechargeable batteries. I was going to order another set but Amazon is out of stock.,

B06ZZ8Y89F,Donald Wisowaty,4.0 out of 5 stars,16-Feb,2018,Seems to work just fine so far. My only dislike is that the batteries can be ejected from the unit if not careful when taking them out.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Neptune10,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Jul,2018,I like that they came in their own boxnice.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Rockhead,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-May,2018,Charger works well. Would be better if the wall charger was included. Just started using batteries so no comments as of this date.,

B06ZZ8Y89F,Bob N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Feb,2018,The charger works as designed. I used a standard USB to charge the batteries and subsequently charged my Samsung with the batteries without issue. the led indicators showed the charge level etc.,

B06ZZ8Y89F,Jordy,1.0 out of 5 stars,4-Apr,2018,Did not fit. Also the leads on the positive side of both batteries move to the edges where the terminals meet on the battery risking fire or explosion. These ARE NOT SAFE. DO NOT BUY.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,monique h.,1.0 out of 5 stars,31-Mar,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,WRO,3.0 out of 5 stars,24-Apr,2018,Charger works well and charges fast. Gave 3 stars because I thought the 18650 batteries included were flat topped they are not so I cannot use them in my mod.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,bananachunks,3.0 out of 5 stars,9-Aug,2018,"I needed new batteries for my vape mod.  For this price why not replace my 2+ year old charger as well?  Love the charger - I like seeing what level charge each battery has instead of just red for charging and green for done like with my old charger.  The batteries on the other hand - I'm not impressed.  First these batteries are slightly bigger than a normal 18650.  That said they did fit my vape mod.  And they were great for the first two weeks.  Now ending my third week both batteries are showing ""low battery"" when they get down to about 50% in my vape mod.  Charge it back up to 100% in either the vape mod itself or in the included charger then they die once they get back down to 50% or maybe a little more.  So less than a month and I have to replace my batteries.  The three stars are for the charger (if the product listing was for the charger alone it would get five stars).  I will be steering clear of Victagen 18650 Lithium Batteries from here out.",
B06ZZ8Y89F,CORN,2.0 out of 5 stars,24-Aug,2018,The charger is not working,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,10-Aug,2018,Both batteries had damage to the protective layer causing the batteries to be unsafe. Will be returning.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,The Haggerty Family,3.0 out of 5 stars,28-Mar,2018,We just received the charger it came with two 18650 batteries 3200mAh that are labeled Victagen as is the charger itself. Also included in the package was a short (few inches at best) usb to usb micro cable. No A/C adapter but I believe the listing stated this. The information printed on the box and in the included directions was clearly written by someone who is less than proficient in the English language. Many grammatical errors and poorly worded/strange statements. I plugged it into the wall using my Samsung phone charger as suggested by the goofy directions. I inserted the batteries and was greeted by flashing blue lights above both ports indicating the batteries already had a half charge. The batteries don't seat very securely so care has to be taken not to bump or shift the charger. I had one battery flip out and sail about 10 inches from the charger when I accidentally bumped it with my foot. I have my doubts as to the validity of the claimed 3200 mAh rating on the batteries. The charger has two modes 1a charging and 0.5a charging which can be switched by pressing a mode button on the front face of the charger. It seems to be working as advertised so far but I've only had it for about an hour so far. I have the combo a 3 star ratings based on the wonky directions and unstable seating of the batteries in the charging ports. The box and directions state that the charger can be used as a battery bank (to charge cell phones or similar devices) by placing a charged battery in the left charging slot and using supplied usb cable (There is a regular USB port on charger for battery bank use and a USB micro port for charging purposes). However based on how unstable the battery seating is in the charger I don't think this is a practical use as you would be constantly re-inserting the batteries when they pop out. Maybe it would be feasible if you left it in a stationary location and didn't use the device you were charging. Regardless you get what you pay for and for 20 or 30 bucks as long as it keeps working I feel it was worth the purchase.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,chris iuliano,4.0 out of 5 stars,15-Feb,2018,Charger works well. But the batteries do not fit in an ecig. So if you're a vaper looking for batteries they wont work.UPDATE 2: I was quickly offered an apology and replacement. So far the replacement is working well. Its been a few months now and it still works correctly. So I'm thinking the last one was just an anomaly. Its working now no complaints. Good customer service. So if you do have a problem they will replace the unit.UPDATE 1: I bought this in mid february. by the end of march the charger stopped working properly. I believe the usb connection on the charger is faulty as I have to move the cable into different positions til i find a position that makes it work. Then even when there is a connection the batteries do not charge properly. sometimes when I only have 1 battery charging the other side is going as well (with no battery). The charger lights will look like its charging but the battery never charges.Seems to me like I got a faulty charger.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,M,1.0 out of 5 stars,12-Aug,2018,The two battery slots adjust via tension springs to accommodate varying battery sizes.  The first slot's spring broke off it's coupling when I tried to put the battery in less than 30 seconds out of the box.  Why? Why bother making something this cheaply?  If it costs more to make something that works then spend more to make it work and then pass it on to me.  This is the second charger I've bought off Amazon this past week and I'm 0/2 on functional chargers so far.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Shaylee Polk,2.0 out of 5 stars,25-Mar,2018,Bought these to replace my old 18650 batteries but they don't fit. Also the batteries wiggle around a lot inside the charger and it's hard to line them up right. The upside is it does work as a power bank.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Mr Mitch,4.0 out of 5 stars,11-Apr,2018,Works as described. Better than my old Radio Shack one.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Andrew Baker,3.0 out of 5 stars,12-Sep,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,William F.,3.0 out of 5 stars,13-Sep,2018,It works(ish) I searched vape batteries and I found these they work if you have another type or battery with it because at least with my vape it sits too high because of the cathode,
B06ZZ8Y89F,A.T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Mar,2018,Great deal. Works good so far.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Cspotts,2.0 out of 5 stars,24-Jul,2018,This charger is listed as being for 18650Li batteries but also fits many other sizes by using a spring assisted sliding contact on the (-) end.That's very cool in principle but in practice it acts less like a useful contact and more like a battery launcher since there's nothing to hold the batteries in place besides the pressure exerted by that spring. At the slightest provocation (a door slamming on the other side of the house for instance) the battery will slip loose and launch about 3 feet in whichever direction it happens to be facing.Needless to say that's very frustrating since I intended to use this product in my work vehicle to charge my headlamp batteries.This product earns two stars because it does seem to charge the batteries quickly and they worked quite well in my headlamp. That said the frustration of constantly retrieving batteries as they fly across the room has led me to request a return on day one of ownership.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Louis,1.0 out of 5 stars,4-Mar,2018,Terrible product not even a couple weeks charging piece broke,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Rose Lamb,2.0 out of 5 stars,22-Jun,2018,Since they don't fit in the vape even though they are the 18650 I can't say whether they are a good battery or not. If you're looking to buy a battery for your vape this might not fit.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Ashley,1.0 out of 5 stars,6-Jun,2018,Had to return batteries wouldn't stay in to charge,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Ashley,2.0 out of 5 stars,26-Feb,2018,This works as advertised but the batteries do not fit securely. There is a lot of play and they can easily slide off the prong. I bought this for a solar charger to wear on my pack and charge while hiking. The batteries will not stay in place if moving.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,DaveF,3.0 out of 5 stars,23-Feb,2018,I did receive this at a discount but as you can see I can only provide a candid review. The one thing that drew me to this set was that you could use the charger as a battery bank. The other was that they were rated at 3200mAh. Now the real question is how reliable is that rating? Turns out it is a bit optimistic. I bought a battery charger/tester to see how good or bad they really are. From left to right: The two Victagen batteries then the Moobibear (came with a flashlight) and finally a Harbor Freight battery that came with a light. The Harbor Freight battery surprised me the most. I will admit this charger doesn't test discharge rates and loads but at least for the capacity it should be pretty close. So the short answer is the Victagen came up short of the 3200 mHa rating at approx. 83% and 87%. Could I have received two questionable batteries? You can decide.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,SomeareainMichigan,4.0 out of 5 stars,12-Apr,2018,The original unit developed an issue with the units power cutting in/out where the micro USB input went into the charger.  I contacted the seller they asked for a video and I received a replacement very quickly.  Over all I like the features of this charger :  It charges multiple battery types and it comes with two very nice 18650 batteries for the price.  A great feature of the unit is that it will charge your phone by reversing the USB part of the cord from the charger and the micro USB into your phone or device needing charged  Not a deal breaker  but the 18650 batteries do not stay securely in the charger if you are moving or carrying the charger..  The  replacement charger is working flawlessly and I am pleases with the service and product I received.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,caleb J. Skeen,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-Aug,2018,For a odd size battery it works well,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Abhi Bhatt,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Feb,2018,This is a great product for charing my lithium ion batteries! It charges my AA and AAA batteries excellently. The display showing the battery % charged is also very nice. I also really like that I can use this as a power bank! It charges with a micro USB which is universal.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,luke,5.0 out of 5 stars,13-Jun,2018,it's a nice battery easy to charge. Also we can clearly check the battery's remaining charge on the charger. The quality of the battery looks good. Charging interface can be used on all usb interfaces.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Big Steve from Seymour (by Gawd) Texas,2.0 out of 5 stars,23-Apr,2018,Power connection broke loose inside charger after two months.  Didn't move it much in the two months that I've had it; so I didn't really connect/disconnect the charger very much.  It just sits on a table plugged in.  When it worked it was fine.  It just didn't last long.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Bast,1.0 out of 5 stars,2-Oct,2018,1 battery was dud out of the box the other one started playing after a few days of use. going to try another brand.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Navy Chuck,4.0 out of 5 stars,22-Oct,2018,Arrived with half charged batteries.  The charger brought them to 100% in about an hour. You will need you own adapter from USB to AC source.  Checked the batteries a couple of days later and they are holding their charge.  I will update if any problems are encountered.U[date - had the items for a couple of weeks now.  Batteries hold charge fine.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Oct,2018,Works great and i can even use to charge my phone so awesome,
B06ZZ8Y89F,BKAZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,31-Oct,2018,Returned. Did not work correctly out of box. Did not try batteries.,
B06ZZ8Y89F, Chronologically gifted,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-Oct,2018,,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Craig Rooke,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-Oct,2018,Fits perfectly in the hand and casts a long powerful beam. The adjust function helps to focus in on far-off subjects. Feels very well made. Great value.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,2-Oct,2018,Dont waste your time or money. Charger worked but the batteries were terrible.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Frankenstein,4.0 out of 5 stars,6-Oct,2018,just ok,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Ahmad,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-Sep,2018,Great product very cool that it allows for charging different types of batteries at the same time. This charger also has an unexpected capability built in. It can function as a battery pack to recharge your USB devices.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Bigbird1951,5.0 out of 5 stars,3-Jul,2018,Real easy to charge and like ability to use to power or charge mobile devices too.,
B06ZZ8Y89F,Tadeh D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,2-Nov,2018,Nice quality,
B01N6GA9ZL,Stephen D Chisholm,5.0 out of 5 stars,18-Apr,2017,Planned a camping trip to the Southwest on short notice.  Knowing we were going to be staying in less developed campsites a table would be a key convenience but it had to fly with the rest of the gear without exceeding checked-bag weight and bulk.  This seemed like just the thing and I was far from disappointed. Due to the low price I went ahead and bought both sizes and found them to be so light and compact that I packed both. Setup is super easy though fitting the top requires enough tension and finicky orientation of the flat tube that the kids needed help with just that step.  It takes just 30-45 seconds including removal from the bag: it's that quick.  The table is strong and reasonably firm due to the tension across the top and the rigid battens.  If we had one quibble it's that the cupholders are perfect for a can or standard bottle but if you add a coozy or want to stash a larger bottle ( cooking oil during food prep e.g.) the diameter is too small.  Breakdown is as quick as setup.  We used the larger table for dining with 4 small chairs we brought to set gear on while loading the car and for food prep.  The smaller one made a handy side table near the fire and fit nicely in the tent vestibule to keep shoes and gear off the ground.  We even found that if we left off the top it made a perfect elevated stand for our Coleman stove.  Try this at your own risk of course but it worked great for us though it required propping the propane canister so it didn't hang free at the side ( our usual liquid fuel model would work better) .  We were actually at an unbelievably gorgeous and isolated National Forest campsite overlooking a red rock canyon just a few miles from Bryce when I checked my email for the first time in days and was gratified to find a personal thank-you note from the storefront owner with extra setup tips.  The tips were unnecessary as we had just enjoyed a meal prepared on one table and served on the other and had moved on to enjoy beer and cookies by the fire with the smaller one.  The tables really were key gear for making the trip work and I look forward to discovering the many more ways they will surely prove themselves useful.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Michael,4.0 out of 5 stars,15-Jan,2017,I ordered the large version of the table for camping trips because I got tired of using my pack as a table.  The table assembles easily and comes to about knee height when setup so is about a foot shorter than a conventional table but the perfect height for my backpacking stool.  The table is easy to setup and to roll back up.  When packed the bundle is about 2.5 ft long and about 4 inches wide so is a bit awkward to strap horizontally.  Not a big deal if you already have a tent to carry though.  The cup holders are wide enough to hold a beer but probably only a very thin water bottle.  The table feels relatively strong given how small it is but I would definitely hesitate to put more than about 25-30lbs on it.  I expect to use it more for eating and maybe playing cards as opposed to someplace to put my pack on.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Ernie L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jan,2017,"Great portable table for a day at the park or car camping.  The table is very easy to setup and take down with very few parts.  I have seen similar tables where the side supports are hinged and fold instead of them being separate parts like in this unit.  I think I would prefer them to be hinged as it would minimized the risk of leaving something behind.The surface is pretty is under tension and ends up being pretty taut which is great in case you want to put a drink down on top.  This also makes it ideal for a plate of food.My table weighed in at 1168grams measured about 31"" long and 3"" around when it was all packed up.This should make a nice addition to the gear collection.",
B01N6GA9ZL,Kevin A. Garner,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-May,2017,Excellent little table. I took it backpacking/hiking 6 miles into the backcountry at Cumberland Island sea shore. It was incredibly handy especially when night rolled around and we wanted to play cards. The cup holders really set it apart frol many of the other options. All the other guys were interested in their own one. Next we'll probably pick the larger one up for family picnics and tailgating - the red would plbe perfect for Wolfpack football games.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Diggity Kid,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Aug,2017,The OUTRY Lightweight Folding Table is a great product.  In was a little skeptical when purchasing it but the all.of the reviews are accurate.  It is extremely lightweight durable and easy to setup and take down.  I have even handed the job of table setup to my 8 year old who is even able to set it up and tear it down.  The table is also quite strong for its size.  I had a good 20 lbs of stuff sitting on it with no ill effect.  The packaged size is also extremely small considering how large the table is.  I would highly recommend this table as well as the vendor who shipped this product very fast and packaged the table very well do not was very well protected in transit.  5 stars all the way.  You cannot go wrong with this table!,
B01N6GA9ZL,dk2017Top Contributor: Camping,4.0 out of 5 stars,20-Sep,2017,This is super lightweight and is great as a table during picnics.  It's a little bumpy so tall glasses may be a little unstable and it's so light it's easy to bump.  I thought the cupholders would get in the way but I don't seem to mind them.  The weight of this table makes it a real option for bringing backpacking too which is a huge luxury so that's a plus.There are a few items that I would change if I could figure out how: 1) The cupholders are rigid so the table top is limited to how tightly it can wrap around the legs.  Not a huge deal but could be a tighter package.  2) The legs are long so the overall package is long and skinny when folded.  A little annoying if you want to throw it in a backpack (it's light enough otherwise).  I would strap it to the outside but there are no handles or daisy chains to connect it to outside straps.  This means that you would have to cinch it down really tight which may bend the aluminum legs.  Some additional loops for purchase on the cover would alleviate the problem or a way to fold the legs down shorter would also help.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Oscar A,5.0 out of 5 stars,27-Sep,2017,Ok ok so maybe i havent been camping with it but i have taken it to a few BBQs where it has performed like a BOSS. 1st time I took it out of the pouch to set it up the instructions slipped out without my noticing it. Turns out I didn't need them it's so simple and intuitive to assemble. Once assembled all you need is to find some stable ground so it wont wobble and your all set.Our grill is a small portable one that's very close to the ground so this table was the perfect height to hold everything at arms length beer tongs and snacks while tending the grill and even as a pit stop for the hot dogs and steaks going on and coming off the grill. It held a lot of weight without buckling or even sagging.Over all it is a great lightweight sturdy table great for BBQs and even at home for the kids. I set it up for my 2 year old nephew to put toys on and hold his bottle of water in the cup holders.Overall amazing product. Money well spent.,
B01N6GA9ZL,The Walbs,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-Jan,2017,This is a great little table. It is very compact and at the same time quite large and sturdy when put together. With 4 cup holders and plenty of space this makes an excellent camping/hunting/outdoors table to take with you.I tested the weight and it held well above what you would expect. I had 2 1 gallon milk jugs on the table and it held sturdy without much dip to it. I'm sure it could hold even more without an issue.The table takes about 1 min to put together so very easy assembly.The height of the table might be a little low for some but most should be just fine with it. It would make a great kids table as well if that fits your needs.All in all i would easily recommend this table to anyone looking for a popup table to travel with.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Greg Grant,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jan,2017,What a great little table.  So versatile and easy to use you can take it anywhere.My wife & I got this figuring it would be great to take to the beach with us.  And it works great and folds up so it can be packed away very easily.  I'll probably actually take it with me when I fly my quadcopter too.  Because I can use the cup holders to put extra batteries and tools I need and the table is large enough for my quadcopter itself and other parts in case I need to make a repair out in the field.I am very happy with this purchase I expect it to get a lot of use from us in the future.,
B01N6GA9ZL,kbslc,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Aug,2017,Have not used the  table yet. It is going for the solar eclipse in three weeks for camping. I easily put it together and it appears sturdy and convenient for my purpose of having a place to set food and drink while socializing being seated. I would not put a camp stove on this as it is a mesh/canvas type of material. It is compact for storage in a bag and lighter weight. Nice quality of construction.  Wish I had purchased two of them.  I will use this when I go plein air painting so it will be well loved.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Flyingvedhead,5.0 out of 5 stars,21-Apr,2017,This table is EXACTLY what I wanted!  Our family does a lot of outdoor activities - not camping but concerts in the park tailgates at various events going to the beach etc. - and not having a flat space for food & whatnot is a challenge.  This table solves that problem.  I especially like the cup holders b/c it allows you to put your beverage down and even if the table gets jostled your drink won't spill.  The cup holders are also handy little pockets to tuck stuff if you don't need all 4 to hold drinks.  It is easy to assemble and easy to transport - it now lives in the back of our minivan ready for the next adventure! Yeah with a minivan the adventures are tame .. but still tame adventures need flat spaces to put stuff!  This table suits our needs perfectly.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Luckeeeelinda,5.0 out of 5 stars,18-Jul,2017,We camp in our Eurovan Weekender. Looking for compact easy to store furniture this table fits the bill in every way. Collapsed it's small and light. It's easy to set up and sturdy to use. We're so please to have it. The seller was helpful and got product to us in a reasonable time. Since we had no problems with the purchase there was no interaction but I have the feeling that the seller would handle any problems with professionalism.,
B01N6GA9ZL,A,5.0 out of 5 stars,14-Feb,2018,Never thought I would like a table enough to write a review on it. I took it with me on a multi-day hike.  It easily strapped in its carry bag to the outside of my pack.I was the only person out of 4 who even thought to bring a table. It was luxury at its finest we used to to eat on play cards on even some impromptu first aid it was nice to have a table to set the bandages and stuff on to keep clean.I have the large table and plan to purchase the small one for personal use when camping.,
B01N6GA9ZL,C. MENDOZA,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-Sep,2017,Arrived pretty quickly. Simple packaging. Easy to assemble. Came with single sheet instructions and carrying sleeve. The table while set up can take some rough handling without coming apart. I haven't owned any portable tables but I feel this product is well designed. Very lightweight. You must still be mindful when setting things down on it. Happy camper,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,10-Sep,2018,Brought this camping with us and it made a world of difference for holding phones and portable fans. Assembles easily and folds down to a slim profile that is easy to pack and store. Cloth and metal rods appear to be made of sturdy but light material. Worksmanship appears to be good with no problems in the stitching. Drawstring storage bag holds everything easily. Really well made product.,
B01N6GA9ZL,"Birds Fan ""Barb""",5.0 out of 5 stars,6-Jan,2018,The table is very well designed and meets all our expectations.  The top surface depends on the support structure to draw the fabric taught.  The cup holders insure that tipsy tall drinks don't fall over due to the supporting bars below the table top surface.  The package is light as could be expected given the surface of its top.  Quality of construction insures many years of life covering many many assemblies and dis-assemblies.  The design is to be admired.  Its assembly has many steps but is easily mastered.  Well worth the purchase for picnics day hikes car camping etc.,
B01N6GA9ZL,s.mathews,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-Jul,2017,Bought this little table to put in the back of the pick up or jeep for those unexpected picnics and lunch stops. Also for backpacking.  Also bought the bigger one for my sons family for his camping trips.  it is a great little extra that doesn't take up much room but makes the difference between a juggling act and a pleasant lunch. love it.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Jul,2017,Great little table at a reasonable cost. I have used the table on quad riding expeditions and at an airshow. The table works great for impromptu outings as it is so small and light when packed up that we keep in in the car all the time. Easily fits in my front box on the quad along with couple of the little light weight chairs and a tarp. Makes a nice lunch stop.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Ethan,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Aug,2017,We love this little table! It's very lightweight but sturdy and simple to set up. The smaller table is good for sitting on towels at the beach or on a blanket during a picnic whereas I think the taller table would be better if you are going to be in lawn chairs. I highly recommend this product.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,19-Jan,2017,This is an excellent table.  I purchased because of the light weight 4 cup holders proper dimensions and very fair price. It sets up easier and is even more stable that what I had anticipated.My ONLY suggestion is that the cup holders be wide enough to accommodate a can with a coozie around it.  As the holders are now the holders only accommodate a bare can.This is a great buy and I highly recommend it.,
B01N6GA9ZL,V. Wolfe,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Aug,2017,Great little table used it both at the beach and backpacking.  It holds two cans and some snacks.  It would hold for example a full back of chips some dip those 2 drinks and 2 sandwiches.If you want more space get the bigger table.I went backpacking last weekend and it was super convenient.,
B01N6GA9ZL,B.H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-Jun,2018,,
B01N6GA9ZL,RelizzScholar27,5.0 out of 5 stars,26-Jul,2017,We love this table. It's lightweight but very sturdy. Snapping parts together takes a little bit of muscle but once you get the hang of it you're fine. We take this to beach with us all the time and are so glad to be able to have space for drinks food cellphones etc. that's away from the sand. Thanks Lucille & crew for a great addition to our easy beach equipment kit!,
B01N6GA9ZL,L. Stephan,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Oct,2017,I purchased this table to use on our pontoon boat.  It was the perfect choice.  Table is easy to assemble and disassemble and stores compactly.  The table top is rigid so meals on the boat are easier to manage.  Cupholders are a plus and we found them to be deep enough to offer true stability.  Legs are stable and cushioned so our floor surface is not marred from use.,
B01N6GA9ZL,T. Zee,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Jun,2017,Shipped quickly and arrived as advertised. We were able to use this table to eat off of on our first camping trip (2 adults and 2 kids). Easy to set up in less than 1 minute.  The spring clip that holds the bag shut was damaged when first shipped. However the seller responded quickly and will be sending a replacement.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Valerie Tagliavia,5.0 out of 5 stars,27-Oct,2017,Sits a bit low but awesome companion for a sand/beach chair and quite a sturdy top!  Like the addition of cup holders...so practical.  This was bought as a gift and I think it will go over well.  I haven't used it so this review is based on the fact that I was able to put it together in my house and then easily break it down and get it back in its bag.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Tech Geek,5.0 out of 5 stars,12-Oct,2017,Love this table.  I purchased small lightweight chairs to leave in the trunk as we go to a lot of music festivals camping trips wineries etc.  The chairs had no armrests or places to put drinks food etc.  This table works perfectly for our needs.  It's very small and lightweight but strong holds enough food and the best feature is that our drinks don't fall off.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Jimmy K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,18-Apr,2017,Bought this to take backpacking for a couple day trip.  Worked as advertised and other reviews are accurate. product met all specifications and is a sturdy table considering the weight and materials used. My only comment would be the cup holder size wish it was a little larger to fit larger cups if you have canned beverages this is not a problem.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Chris Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,13-Sep,2017,I purchased this table for a canoe trip that I was going on for Labor Day weekend. I absolutely cannot be more satisfied with the durability and sturdiness of this product. Everything snapped together very easily and did not require instructions to figure out. The cup holders were a nice bonus as well. I highly recommend this for anybody looking for a very lightweight and durable table 4 short hiking or canoe trips.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Curtis from KY,5.0 out of 5 stars,12-Apr,2018,I wanted a bed side table for deployment and this more than filled that need and goes with me on camping and military trips alike. Choose the larger size if you want something you can use from a chair or a cot. The cup holders are awesome but cant handle too much weight. It gets compliments all the time when I set it up. It sets up very fast and collapses easily.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,16-Aug,2018,Excellent product very well made good quality  easy to put together after the first time light weight can be very functional in many ways.  I use it when going riding with side by sides due to lightweight and compact size .,
B01N6GA9ZL,Kyle Candilasa,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-Oct,2017,Bought a couple weeks ago but didn't actually get to use it till this weekend. Excellent table. Folds to fit in pack and super light. 2 cup holders perfect for gf and me. Used this backpacking and table was sufficient for small thing for me and 5 friends. Cheaper that other name brand ones. Just as good.,
B01N6GA9ZL,DKRitt,5.0 out of 5 stars,23-Feb,2017,This table is amazing! So light yet when you assemble it the table is very sturdy. Easy to put together in a snap and the carry case is handy too. Would be wonderful for backpacking or anywhere you want a handy table that is easy to tow. The top doesn't sag a bit and the colors are metallic and perfect for a little color to your campsite.I am ordering two more right now one large and one smaller.Customer service is top notch and I will definitely would recommend to my friends!,
B01N6GA9ZL,Jon H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-Aug,2018,,
B01N6GA9ZL,RSchussler,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-Jul,2017,The article arrived promptly. We liked it and ordered another which arrived on time as well.  Worked great at the beach for family reunion dinners.  First year there was not sand in the second helpings.  Sets up easy and has quality material.  Only  minor negative thing is both cases had a  band of gooey residue on them from tape I guess.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Laurie Smith,3.0 out of 5 stars,25-Feb,2017,The instructions say that 'moderate pressure' is required to snap the top into the frame but I found it very challenging. Returned the table and Buyer replaced it with another table that works a little better.,
B01N6GA9ZL,NSA Saechao,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-May,2017,I was looking for a small foldable table for me when im at the beach with my kids and I found this well designed portable table that i can use at the beach and camping every time its so convenient.  Its quick to assemble and sturdy for what i need it for. I would recommend this to anyone  who is looking for a small simple foldable table.,
B01N6GA9ZL,C. Cook Effects,5.0 out of 5 stars,26-Jul,2018,I was not expecting this table to be so cool! It rolls up very small and the legs fold. When you assemble it the top pulls nice and tight and there are support bars. We took this to a music festival and had drinks bottles food and all sorts of things on it and it didn't cave. Nice compact size perfect for a weekend trip or a picnic!,
B01N6GA9ZL,westromdesign,4.0 out of 5 stars,4-May,2017,great design easy to assemble light very portable stable good looking and fairly sturdy.One design flaw though - the lack of shoulder strap for the carry bag.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Aug,2017,I bought this for my go-bag (We have a lot of wildfires in California) in case we have to evacuate on short notice.  I tested it with a 5 gallon water container and it worked great.  Recently pulled it out for an outdoor concert with friends and it was fantastic.,

B01N6GA9ZL,Denise in Florida,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Jun,2017,I purchased the smaller table to take to the monthly outdoor Jazz Festivals in Fort Lauderdale. It's very lightweight but very sturdy. We have to park our car a good number of blocks away so it is the perfect lightweight match to our chairs in a bag for carrying to the festival. The festival gets quite crowded so this small table is great for 2-3 persons for snacks and drinks. love it!,
B01N6GA9ZL,Linda g,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Jun,2018,This is a really good table. It supports the weight of a lot of stuff. Folds up easy and snaps back into place to use. Good carrying case too,
B01N6GA9ZL,Timothy Walker,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-Aug,2017,I wanted a sturdy table that wouldn't take up much space when traveling and this table is just what I was looking for.

B01N6GA9ZL,Edward Ernest,5.0 out of 5 stars,16-Aug,2017,This table is pretty cool and very functional stable and portable. I am using it for camping and lounging in the backyard. The cup holders are a great feature that prevents spills.,
B01N6GA9ZL,PattieLo,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Aug,2017,Perfect for any time you need a table when traveling or an extra place to put drinks and snacks in the yard.  Very lightweight easy to assemble and take apart.  Comes with a bag so easy to carry as well.  We use it for outdoor events and can fit quite a bit on it.  There are two sizes; this larger one is ideal for our needs.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,1-Aug,2017,"Light sturdy and a great addition to our beach set up. Would certainly work for camping as well. Drink holders are a bit ""budgey"" but they do the job. This is a nice piece and seems higher quality than the cost.",
B01N6GA9ZL,Charlie718,5.0 out of 5 stars,5-Sep,2017,We brought this with us for our beach vacation.  It was great.  Very easy to travel with and store.  Table is sturdy.  So far so good.  I would recommend this purchase.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Dogloopy,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-Sep,2017,Great table! It is super sturdy easy to set up and light enough to take backpacking. I would heartily recommend it to anyone who is considering such a purchase.Also I received great service from Lucille at Outry! She took the time to write a message about the assembly and to make sure the product met my needs. She brought a personal touch that is often sorely missing from online store purchases. Five stars for Outry as well!,
B01N6GA9ZL,Robert,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Aug,2017,An excellent light weight portable but sturdy camping table. Have only used it once but it worked well as a side table at meal time at our campsite. Highly recommend.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Abby TS,5.0 out of 5 stars,27-Jun,2017,Great table so far easy to put together and sturdy. It is the perfect height for use next to our backpacking chairs which are low to the ground. The storage is also very easy and when it is in the storage bag it takes up very little room. This was a great buy!,
B01N6GA9ZL,Eileen George,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Mar,2017,Exactly what I wanted. Very sturdy and once you put it together then the next time it's easy! We take it to the beach. Only suggestion would be to make the carrier A bit bigger it's almost impossible to get all the pieces back inside.,
B01N6GA9ZL,KLB,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Sep,2018,We use this table when we are at the soccer field. It is quick and easy to setup and the table is very sturdy. It gives us plenty of room to rest our phones and drinks and some treats. Perfect for what we need it for.,

B01N6GA9ZL,Jeffrey L Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-May,2017,My wife and I go to outdoor concerts quite a bit during the summer and we bought this table so we don't have to put everything on the floor.  I didn't want a heavy table because normally there is a bit of a walk before hand.  Setup is very easy and the table is very light weight.  I can't wait to use it!,
B01N6GA9ZL,rebmystic,5.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jun,2018,Early review we have used it a few times.  Well constructed easy to put together and nice flat stable surface.  We use it at the beach and camping.  Super happy with the purchase so far.  Great value.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-Sep,2017,Awesome table!  I was looking to simplify my car camping set up and was looking for compact gear; this table fits the bill.  This table is simple to set up it's sturdy durable and has built in cup holders.  It is everything I was looking for and more.  If you are on the fence about ordering one just order it you will not be disappointed.  The seller is very professional and polite and ships extremely quickly.,

B01N6GA9ZL,ShanChicago,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Aug,2017,This is a great little table for camping. It is very light and collapses down to hardly any space at all. When assembled the tabletop is very taught and functional and the whole thing is very sturdy. I only wish there was an option without the cupholders as most of our camp chairs already have them and the extra table space would be nice. Overall I highly recommend this item.,
B01N6GA9ZL,D. Pomeroy,3.0 out of 5 stars,15-Jan,2018,Had a broken clasp. If it wasn't broken this would be a great table - especially for the price.,

B01N6GA9ZL,K.Mint,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Aug,2018,We backpacked in and spent 3 nights in the wilderness. This table was a great addition. Lightweight. Set up was easy. The height and size was great with our stools. The cup holders were nice for cups but also to hold things like sunscreen bug spray etc...,
B01N6GA9ZL,Jane,5.0 out of 5 stars,10-Aug,2017,This is a surprisingly simple very light-weight pack-away beach table which provides ample space for two supper plates two drinks and assorted food containers.  The frame keeps the foldable top in good tension and the table steady.  It does not get top-heavy. It takes 30 seconds to assemble or dissemble. It is easy to wash/wipe clean.  Absolutely perfect for sunset dinners on the beach!!,
B01N6GA9ZL,michael e sherwin,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-Jul,2017,Fantastically light and sturdy; it made a wonderful addition to our tent and kept us organized.,
B01N6GA9ZL,T.C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,3-Aug,2018,The one I received was already opened by someone else and obviously returned. This table is so flimsy and does not stay taught or flat. I cant imagine you could use it for anything other than a cup holder. It bows so bad in the middle. Very disappointed.,
B01N6GA9ZL,E. Yuter,4.0 out of 5 stars,1-Aug,2017,Have not used table yet. Set it up in my living room and the quality seems equal to similar tables costing $100 or more. Set up was easy and intuitive. Can't wait to use it on my next camping trip in the Canadian Rockies.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Kelly Tartamella,5.0 out of 5 stars,16-Sep,2018,Love this table. Should have gotten the larger one.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Garrett K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Aug,2017,Great little camping table. We used it for a week in California and it sure beats placing a paper plate on your lap!  The other friends that were there continuously commented on how nice the table is.  We had to fly out so weight and space were at a premium. This table is tough light and affordable. Don't waste your money on the more expensive products... this is what you need!,
B01N6GA9ZL,Aaron S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,3-Apr,2017,Love this table! Surprisingly sturdy and large enough to put multiple plates on it. Sets up and tears down very easily. Top is very taught and solid.,

B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-May,2017,Takes a couple of times to get the hang of putting it together but works like a champ once you figure it out!  Lucille - the inventor - is very helpful and takes pride in her work.  We used the table at a beach with 20+ mph and it stayed put with just the legs being nestled in the sand.  Lightweight and a great taut surface.,
B01N6GA9ZL,JdunnFB1,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Aug,2017,This is a great lightweight beach/camping table.  We took it to the Outer Banks this summer and used it to hold our reading materials phones snacks and drinks.  It is easy to assemble and take apart every time. The cost was well worth it.,

B01N6GA9ZL,Joseph Kruse,1.0 out of 5 stars,9-Sep,2018,Do not buy this. It does not assemble correctly! I couldn't even take it on my camping trip. Waste of time.,

B01N6GA9ZL,Bridge Michael Rowell,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jan,2018,I purchased the little one with the two cup holders. Very flat surface - it's a cloth like surface with some ridges so its not 100% flat but it's great for camping. Great for putting coffee cup food and other random camping items that you do not want to have directly on the floor. Could also really be used inside the tent as a night stand or during rainy days. Really easy to set up. You do have to click the table top pretty hard to get it to click but they come off pretty easily. Everything is in the directions. Fold out like one of those foldable camping chairs and then pop two poles in and then the table top. It's really light weight and folds perfectly in the little carrying bag. Takes less than a minute to set up and take down. In the process of buying another smaller one and the bigger one too!,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,5-Sep,2017,Table works our great for what we need it for! Easy assembly and great storage! Its a sturdy table for drinks and your phones! Awesome buy!!,

B01N6GA9ZL,Iptacita,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-Aug,2017,I bought a few supplies for a camping music festival that I thought might be helpful and this was my best purchase.  It was pretty intuitive to set up but takes a bit of force the first time to get the two rods in but once you do it the first time it is easy and the fact that it is snug just makes it nice and sturdy.  Everyone who came by my campsite remarked on what a neat table it was and it is crazy light and small when folded up.  LOVE IT!  Of course I adorned it with a string of battery operated fairy lights and it became such a nice place to sit around and chat in a campground. Highly recommended!,

B01N6GA9ZL,Dale Reyes,5.0 out of 5 stars,27-Jun,2017,I've been using this every weekend on different camping trips. It's holding up really well. Packs small and sets up fast. It's light enough to be convenient but not light enough to feel too flimsy. This particular table stood out to me out of all the similar products because this table had cup holders. My only complaint is not about the product itself but about the sellers packaging. They used a plastic packaging envelope on each side and stuck the adhesive directly onto the bag that holds the table. That stuff sticks. It left some packaging on the bag. It was an eyesore so I had to sit there and pick it off then come back with some goof off.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,5-Sep,2017,Not that sturdy and a bit annoying to clip together. I would have returned it but had thrown out the box.,
B01N6GA9ZL,Laura,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-Jun,2018,Bought this for a float trip and it was perfect. Lightweight and very sturdy easy to set up. The top is very strong and does not sag at all.,
B01N6GA9ZL,LISA CROSBIE,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Jun,2017,the gift was loved by the recipients - used on their camping trip and said it was perfect!,
B01N6GA9ZL,Stan,5.0 out of 5 stars,27-Jun,2017,I received the table on time and assembling was easy. It looks like this camping table is exactly what I was looking for.,
B01N6GA9ZL,craigery,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Aug,2017,"Really like this table.  The fabric table top DOES NOT sag (before I received the table I assumed that a fabric top might sag -- wrong)!  It is EXTREMELY lightweight and sturdy.Here are the negatives:  You really can't put your legs under it because of the ""X"" supports (see picture).  Even the large size is a bit small for four people to dine but there is ample room for a four hand game of cards!  It took an adjustable pliers to pull the top onto the bottom support structure the first time but that force will probably not be needed in the future if the material stretches slightly.  The table also isn't that high.But the design lightness and sturdiness still gave it a 5 star rating!!!  I needed a lightweight table and this one is it!!!  It actually looks really cool I could see someone using it as a living room end table or something!!!",
B01N6GA9ZL,Susan A,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Jan,2017,Very nice camping table very light.  I would not take it backpacking - not a necessity but great for car camping picnic road trip.. etc.  Packs small and easy to transport.  Does not come with set up directions but pretty self explanatory.  Measurements are correct.  Height is just about the seat level of an average chair.  The cup holders will fit an aluminum can small water bottle tapered water bottle or similar.  They will not fit an average hard plastic water bottle or mug.  But the table is sturdy and has ribbing to hold it rigid.  I am comfortable putting food or open cups on the table and them being secure.  Easy-peasy and usefull!,

B072Z68JW3,Jong Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,15-Jul,2018,,
B072Z68JW3,Joshua Senecal,4.0 out of 5 stars,15-Aug,2018,The pot and pan are quite nice lightweight and appear to be very well made. The pot and pan are coated in a nonstick material which so far has worked well. The fold-out handles are held in place by large thick rivets so I'm not worried about the rivets breaking. Unfortunately the fold-out handles flap about loosely; there is no spring mechanism or similar to keep them folded in or extended out. This can make working with them a bit of a hassle. The plastic insulation/grip has worked well so far. Just make sure your flame stays under the pot and doesn't go up past the side and melt the plastic.The lid's knob is held in place by an actual screw--nice. My only complaint with the lid is the knob is rather low so unless you're really careful you will singe your fingertips when removing it from the pot.The bowls strike me as being fairly useless. They're made of fairly thick and sturdy polypropylene and have a tab to aid in holding them without burning your hands. Problem is they're rather small and hold only 3/4 cup (I measured). This is fine if you're eating something like soup or oatmeal and don't mind refilling your bowl three times. It may be a problem if you make something with larger pieces or long noodles (like I do). The folding ladle similarly is good for dishing out small amounts.One concern is--as provided--the pan is going to scratch easily. They show the pot stacking into the pan for storage which means the pot bottom will scratch the pan surface if it moves about much. You might want to make a point of putting a handkerchief or something in the pan before placing the pot in it prior to packing and storage.,
B072Z68JW3,Dennis A. Amith,4.0 out of 5 stars,7-Jul,2018,,
B072Z68JW3,Bryan Newman,4.0 out of 5 stars,2-Jul,2018,"I love camping gadgets and this one is pretty good.  I have seen more eloquently engineered sets that fit together better.  For example this one requires the mesh bag to hold them all together and some lock together piece by piece.  Also the ladle is a little ridiculous and probably unuseable.  The bowls are minimalist but usable the natural sponge is a baffling inclusion but the wooden spatula/spoon actually seems pretty good.  The Pots themselves are better.  The handles are good enough and the pot lid may actually stay in place a little too well.That sounds like a lot of criticism but for the price this set is worth it for the two pots and the spoon.  They are made fairly well but fairly small.  I'm 6'4"" with a ravenous appetite outdoors so this will work for me and that is about it.  So this is probably a soloist set.  And at .9 pounds it is decently weighted for backpacking.  It would definitely be all the kitchenware you would need to rehydrate freeze dried packets.",
B072Z68JW3,DF,5.0 out of 5 stars,14-Jul,2018,This is a great set!  It has everything to you need to start cooking while camping.  It's sturdy yet lightweight and affordable.  The kit comes with a pot and pan with folding handles that fit together nicely along with the lid.  The whole kit then fits nicely in a mesh bag which can easily fit in most hiking backpacks.  My favorite part is how easy everything is to clean.  Just a quick use of the kit's sponge and you're good to go.  I highly recommend this kit for someone that is starting their camping adventures.,
B072Z68JW3,Christine K. Cornett-McVay,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Jul,2018,This is a very lightweight set and that is key on long hikes where every ounce counts. The pans are very durable. Easy to hold handles fan out for easy removal from cookstove or hold over campfire. Easy to wash. The plastic bowls are less sturdy but serve as easy dishes and are lightweight. Wash easily as well. I usually just eat out of the pan itself. Provided is a plastic top to store a bit of leftovers. Again I never eat leftovers on the trail but nice to have along to store granola etc in.,
B072Z68JW3,loce_the_wizard,3.0 out of 5 stars,19-Jul,2018,I am baffled by this camping cookware set. Not by the various options and features though. I like the lightweight size the look and feel the mesh carrying case the way its various components nest one inside the other like a babushka doll. I like the lightweight ladle and pair of bowls. I like the ecologically sound inclusion of a section of loofah and the bamboo spatula.But whatever gains come from the latter the overuse of plastic bags is beyond belief. Each lid bowl piece was encased in its own ocean-killing plastic bag. Two more large pieces of plastic was also used to keep the smaller box from sliding around in the larger box (sticking with the babushka theme) in which this cookware set was needlessly packed. There is no reason whatsoever that the actual box would not be fine to ship this nonbreakable cookware set.Then there is this puzzling bit of information in the owner's manual: Not suitable for stoves ovens or microwaves. Only use on campfires? So does that mean a portable camp stove or even a table top camp stove may not be used in conjunction with this cookware?Hard to recommend this item at this time. I would like to split the difference and post a 2.5 star review.,
B072Z68JW3,Courtland J. Carpenter,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Jul,2018,Very nice outdoor camping cookware set.  Looks to be a clone of one of the other sets on Amazon that sells for 21.97 that is labeled VGEBY I'm not sure if this is a false name for Amazon Basics or just someone else that sells the same gear from the same manufacturer.  Anyway it's good stuff for the price I don't see one listed under the AB label but if it's similar it's a pretty good bargain for a nice design.  It was even smaller and more compact than I thought.  The nonstick pot and frypan are perfect for cooking meals. They clean up easy with the nonstick coating plus the aluminum allows less heat to get them to temperature so a small cook stove with a can of sterno or a mini propane heater goes a long way.The design allows for the handles to be strapped down on the sides and the interlocking pot and pan allow a more compact system to keep not only the pots but the bowls ladle and lid fit all together and it's not some complex method to put it all away.  I was a boy scout many years ago and I hated KP duty.  Everyone carried a small 7-8 inch heavy black iron frying pan.  They cooked eggs and bacon and then set up a large metal pot on the campfire and the juniors (tenderfoot to first class) had to use a brush to clean all the fry pans.  They cooked bacon and eggs typically but should have cooked the bacon first then the eggs but sometimes didn't these were supposed to be naturally non-stick.  Most were at best partially seasoned so the eggs stuck and you'd have to scrub and scrub.  I'd have loved to have non-stick gear back then.  If I could have asked for more I would want them to include a spork (metal spoon with tines to double as a fork) but in a pinch you could eat with the small spatula included.Recommended for campers or hikers who like quality compact gear they don't have to fuss with.  If it's the same price as the clone a good buy.,
B072Z68JW3,HobbitLyfe,3.0 out of 5 stars,17-Jul,2018,Holy mini cookware...  I saw the dimensions but I guess it didn't register how *small* this set is.  After looking a bit more closely and some comparison it seems this set may be better suited for hiking and instances where you will be carrying lots and need to be aware of your weights. If you're CAMPING and actually setting up and staying somewhere I would definitely go with a different set.  Even for cooking capacity this is small. If you're cooking for JUST YOU it's probably fine but if the other half and I went together I am certain we would need something bigger.  It's a great compact little package and super convenient that it all clips together but the handles weren't great over the fire and the size made them hard to work with.,
B072Z68JW3,Jessica,5.0 out of 5 stars,12-Sep,2018,,
B072Z68JW3,JOSH,2.0 out of 5 stars,10-Oct,2018,This thing is tiny so it is great if you are hiking but not regular camping you could cook one person a very small bowl of rice in it.,
B072Z68JW3,S. Hoffman,4.0 out of 5 stars,18-Oct,2018,They're thinly coated (maybe anodized?) but a neat little set. Smaller than I expected but they'll work for small camp cooking items and such. Not bad for the price. The handles cannot come in contact with fire/high heat and don't seat quite flush when folded. They are compact when bedded together.,
B072Z68JW3,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,8-Oct,2018,I have only used this pan once and this is what happened.  It wont come off no matter how much scrubbing I do. I like the size and weight but not what it did to my food and wont get clean.,
B074X2LK3L,Sierra ,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-Oct,2018,Beginning with the sound it is spectacular the levels of low and treble that allows you to use it is spectacular its construction is of very good quality. Good microphone quality and excellent sound. I not only uses it for gaming but also for listening to music and talking on the phone I like it very much.,
B074X2LK3L,Ignacio Mendoza,5.0 out of 5 stars,15-Nov,2017,These are a good beginner gaming headset. They're a bit too bulky for me but it will do. The lights are great the microphone is flexible and you can rotate the placement of the mic as well. The sound quality is good as well. It comes with an adapter for your PC. During game play players can hear me very clearly and no annoying white noise or weird background noise. It's very simple to plug in. For PC you have to insert the USB portion into the PC and then connect the mic and sound adapter that comes with the heapdhones on the 3.5 mm Jack to be able to use them. I haven't tried it out for Xbox or PS4 but I'm pretty certain these won't let you down.,
B074X2LK3L,SK,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Jan,2018,Ear pads and the head padding make it comfortable to wear longer hours.The volume and mute buttons works as described.Braided cable adds strength. Clear audio Good bass. Microphone pretty clear.As mentioned in the product page USB is just used for lighting. If lightning not required does not have to connect USB.,
B074X2LK3L,Shepherd,5.0 out of 5 stars,11-Apr,2018,Awesome Looking Great Sound to the ears and other Game players say they can hear us much better. These really Look Cool. The fit is also very comfortable and light but feel sturdy. Microphone is not cumbersome at all and has a very long wire to hook into our XBOX one. Yes it works with XBOX ONE,

B074X2LK3L,Jesus Gomez,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-Jan,2018,I purchased a couple of headsets for me and my brother My brother kept this one. I was looking for something a little on the cheap side but man these sound really good and look awesome as well according to his feedback and for what I saw when I opened the package. Build quality is good for the price and they're really comfortable to wear.It's nice to have volume controls at my hand and being able to mute the microphone.Can recommend this to anyone looking for something a little on the cheapside.,
B074X2LK3L,Pingcheng Wang,5.0 out of 5 stars,14-May,2018,good sound. good mic. very nice look. fast shipping,
B074X2LK3L,Skila,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Oct,2017,The headset itself is great. Audio quality is clear and it is the most comfortable headset and had longer cable that I've ever owned. The ear cups color is cool and do a good job of canceling noise out as well.,
B074X2LK3L,Marie,5.0 out of 5 stars,13-Nov,2017,My hubby is a big MMO and gamer guy (he even larps lol) and these caught his attention as he walked through the door. They light up like his keyboard and mouse he really likes that but he says the quality is well worth the price! Very glad to have gotten my (lovingly named) nerdy guy a great head set.,
B074X2LK3L,Joy,4.0 out of 5 stars,27-Oct,2017,"These are the best headphones I have ever had  and I have bought the 100 + sets. The cord length and the fact that it is wrapped in nylon is really good  because the first thing to break is almost always the cord. The mic is nice and sensitive  yet very flexible and easy to adjust. The headphones seem to work fine without the USB plugged in  but if you want all the cool lights then plug it in too. The headphones sit comfortably on my head however and the only con I found at all in these headphones  if your having a long gaming period they get a little warm on your ears. I think when ever your ears get warm stand up and get a glass of water ""stay healthy and game on"".",

B074X2LK3L,RHumphrey1,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Oct,2017,Works great. For the price you can't beat the sound or quality.,
B074X2LK3L,Bon,4.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jan,2018,These required us to turn the speakers on mute so the sound only played through the headset. I've never had that problem before so I'm not sure why it's happening. Other than that they work fine and my only hesitation with buying more would be that they are very bulky (not heavy) just really big.,
B074X2LK3L,Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Nov,2017,Bought one for my kid since she plays games and listen to music.the Headset is very comfortable and the size fits her well. She likes it a lot especially when she found the blue light were on this is very cool. She barely can hear me when she wears it I am glad we choose the right gift for her.,
B074X2LK3L,megan,5.0 out of 5 stars,15-Jan,2018,This is a great headset! Great sound and mic quality and it's very lightweight!,

B074X2LK3L,lisa murray,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Dec,2017,Considering the price for this headset and at the quality. It is so worth the price dont even hesitate.,
B074X2LK3L,Hanyi,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-Feb,2018,Stylish gaming headphone! I bought it to pair my xbox one and it works perfectly. The sound and sensation is pleasant. The micro can be bent to fit your need. But be sure to have an adaptor to fit the Xbox controller it can fit any other device without adapter though. Great gaming headset!,
B074X2LK3L,mathew,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Oct,2017,Very awesome for the price! No need to spend hundreds of dollars for brand headphones! Very loud and great for gaming all all consoles! Also good for people with big heads like me haha,
B074X2LK3L,Yan Lin Lai,5.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jan,2018,Ever since we bought the headset my son adores it and claims that it is extremely comfortable and the stereo is smooth.,
B074X2LK3L,AARON ZIXI OUYANG,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-Apr,2018,Great gift this gaming headset is so cool. It's a professional headset for games. I love the color and light design. It has cushions on both ears and on the top of the headset. I wore it for hours playing with my friends online. Very comfortable and perfect fit.,
B074X2LK3L,Jeff,4.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jun,2018,Gaming Headset for PS4 Xbox One Micolindun Over Ear Gaming Headphones with Mic Stereo Surround Noise Reduction LED Lights Volume Control for Laptop PC Mac iPad Smartphones (ONE YEAR WARRANTY)I'm very happy with this for the price I paid. There are certainly much more expensive headsets you can get but I I'm not willing to pay that much for them as I am always somehow able to break it. Weather sitting on it ripping a wire out on accident what have you... I just go this as a replacement for a more expensive one I had and I'm very happy with it. It's definitely worth the price. Clear sound and mic I don't see any reason I won't be able to wear this for an extended time either even though I haven't had it long enough to do that yet. (Xbox one user),
B074X2LK3L,Jimmy,5.0 out of 5 stars,12-May,2018,This is a really feature rich headset considering the price you're getting it at. I've had quality headsets in the past to listen to music with but when I'm trying to get my game or chat with friends on the computer - I've been using a desktop mic and this quality here is vastly superior. I don't really use it for console so I can't comment on that aspect all too much but it does seems compatible there.If I'm not in the mood or there's no need to chat I can just tuck the microphone piece away from my mouth. But even when it's near where it should be it's not intrusive at all which is nice. Music quality sounds pretty good but I'm not an extreme audiophile by any means.The headset looks cool too and the LED lights do pop.,
B074X2LK3L,Myst,5.0 out of 5 stars,20-May,2018,I've been using this headset for about a week now and really like the way that it performs. I use it for gaming and to chat on Discord to listen to music and to watch news/videos. The microphone voice clarity is good and I have no complaints about the sound. The blue decorative lights are on a separate USB plug so you don't have to use them if you don't want to.The best feature is the adjustable volume and microphone mute slider switch on the cord - very handy. That piece is a little bulky though I'd like it smaller. This fits both my head (big) and my wife's head (not so big) so seems fairly adjustable and comfortable across a range of sizes. I'm quite happy with this headset -- it meets all of my daily computer/gaming needs!,
B074X2LK3L,Vanessa R.,4.0 out of 5 stars,26-Oct,2017,I bought this pair of headset for my son (12 grade)gaming and listen movie . The ear and head cushions are very comfortable to wear and you can adjust to have the best fit for you. But he felt a little bit easy lose compare wiz the old one .So far pretty good .,
B074X2LK3L,Danielle Mackin,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-Jul,2018,"As a gamer I look for comfort and clarity when playing video games and conversing with my teammates on the line.  This headset was basically everything I needed and more minus the base.  I tried listening to a few songs and the base didn't come through like ""Beats"" headphones would but for those who game - this is it. And it came with adapters - I had one of my friends try to pilfer them from me.Note: While I was paid for testing the product do note what I say is true.",
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Dec,2017,Came fast great sound comfortable and easy to hook up. my computer is kind of awkward but to get MOAR sound i hooked the headphone to the speaker jack and the mic to the computer jack *cause my speakers DO ACTUALLY have both jacks but doesn't have the cord to hook the mic up. i got one of those bass boosters with a big box. doesn't have the mic cable. only the basic speaker hookup. headphones are freaking amazing. and for the price? ALOT FREAKIN BETTER THAN MY 60 DOLLAR HEADPHONES D:,
B074X2LK3L,D. Paul Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,11-Oct,2017,Works great on XBox One. My 7 year old son loves them!,
B074X2LK3L,Feng Leng,5.0 out of 5 stars,11-Oct,2017,I love to listen music always both wesrten and classical. While working or reading books its my habit to listen the music. What I have the head phones are not good quality I need to hang on my ear always. That is why I purchased this headphones to get the music like Home theater.This is the best choice for music lovers especially who like to play computer online games. I will strongly recommend to choose this items.,
B074X2LK3L,Jpot,4.0 out of 5 stars,29-Dec,2017,"There seems to be a loose ""something"" in the left ear muff that I don't hear when I'm gaming so I didn't return it.  Otherwise it has great sound comfortable fit and I like the noise reduction!",

B074X2LK3L,William Reese,4.0 out of 5 stars,24-Mar,2018,Speakers are ok the mic sounds fine. A good headset for the cost.  While the cord is plenty long enough the lights are powered by a USB plug that is connected to the headphone/mic plug with only 3 inches or so of slack between them.  If you don't happen to have a USB near your headphone and mic lugs (or are using it with a console controller) then you will not be able to use the lights.A pretty solid headset for the price though with good sound and build quality,
B074X2LK3L,Annie,5.0 out of 5 stars,11-Jul,2018,I bought this headset for my son. Because his previous headphones were broken he was very happy to play games during the holidays. He said that the microphone and sound quality are very good for this price and he likes the blue light of the headphones.,
B074X2LK3L,Carolyn Nooney,4.0 out of 5 stars,4-Feb,2018,Nice head phones with mic does the job. The lights only come on if you use the USB connection. The 3.5mm  jack for voice and speakers was not a tight fit. I couldn't even plug it into the back port where its suppose to go with the adapter that came with it. I had to use the one in the front which still isn't a good fit and I had to mess with settings on branch new gaming computer to get it to recognize both at the same time.,
B074X2LK3L,Yilynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,10-Apr,2018,,
B074X2LK3L,Brittany,5.0 out of 5 stars,5-Jan,2018,Both the microphone and the sound quality on these are really nice. They are lightweight and not heavy on your head and they don't hurt your ears. They adjust easily. My 13 year old daughter received these as a Christmas gift and she is very happy with them!,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,29-Dec,2017,,
B074X2LK3L,Korrey Rotkiske,4.0 out of 5 stars,31-Dec,2017,The only issue with this headset is the two plugs do not have enough length to have the lights plugged in while using a controller.  This headset is more set up for a pc over console.,
B074X2LK3L,brooklyn boy,5.0 out of 5 stars,23-Dec,2017,worked from the gitgo.I have problems hearing but I can hear other players fine with this headset,
B074X2LK3L,Nichole A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,14-Sep,2018,I got these headphones for my daughter.  She loves to play The Walking Dead on PS4.  I find her all over the house using them to listen and watch Youtube and her videos.  She is a teen and they seem to love having headphones on for most of what they do online.  It has a microphone.  I'm sure she will play with others online one day and then that will come in handy.,
B074X2LK3L,Vick,4.0 out of 5 stars,26-Jun,2018,The headset was really light weight and comfortable. Could hear enemies foot steps clearly. Like most headsets it hurt by ears after a couple hours of use (with or without glasses) also I have headsets that hurt after 4 hours of use. Dont like how the cables feel feels like cheap material. Also the control panel on the cable (that controls volume mic) was a little bulky,
B074X2LK3L,Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-Apr,2018,So we bought this for our son for Christmas and it took him a bit to learn to use it but it's really cool and he loves it. Do not buy the adapter we almost did and then he learned how to operate it but it isn't very clear on the instructions how to make it work. There is a piece on it about midway down that you have to also make sure is turned on for those who are not technologically advanced. I guess he wasn't as far a long as we thought he was!,
B074X2LK3L,EMilio (@theMilsEdition),4.0 out of 5 stars,24-Jun,2018,These work great!! I was playing call of duty and could literally hear footsteps behind me and when I turned around it was an enemy trying to sneak up on me and I stabbed them and got them by surprise. These things are freaking awesome! The only downfall is that they are not wireless but they work as expected.,
B074X2LK3L,RUIJUN HU,5.0 out of 5 stars,18-Jun,2018,Great gaming headphones for the price! Soft padding around the ears and also helps reduce outside noise interference. Padding at the top that rests on your head is also very soft. The microphone folds up for storing when not in use to prevent accidental snags. like the color! iloveit,
B074X2LK3L,Jack,5.0 out of 5 stars,23-Apr,2018,Very comfortable when you wear it. I personally do not like the design but I would still use it because it works really well as an over-ear head set. I do not really ned the microphone but the sound quality is good. You can also have it connect to different devices because it provides multiple plugs. Now I can enjoy my game an without disturbing my families. I would recommend it to my friends who also plays game with me. A great product. Nice and neat.,
B074X2LK3L,R Kang,5.0 out of 5 stars,2-Sep,2018,My son use it  to play his online games.  it work with his computer with the included adapter & the XBOX ONE.  His friends have no problem hearing him.  The noise cancellation mic work great it cancel most background noises.  He cam heard his friend clearly & its very comfortable.,
B074X2LK3L,Alicia Gee,5.0 out of 5 stars,26-Feb,2018,I'm using this on my computer and the sound is great!  I don't have a front USB but I don't care about the lights but I tested and they work well.  It also works on all of our PS4s and XBoxes!  Gotta love the versatility and the price!  The braided cord was an added bonus because my kids kill headsets like crazy!  Will probably order more over the next few weeks so everyone has their on!,
B074X2LK3L,Mauricio Medina,4.0 out of 5 stars,26-Feb,2018,My son loved the headset. He said the sound is good and they can hear him good on the mic. The only thing that sucks is you have to keep the USB to light up the headset connected to something so the led lights can turn on. There is not a switch to turn the lights on or off.,
B074X2LK3L,kenyeta kelly,4.0 out of 5 stars,30-Aug,2018,I purchased this for my son as a Christmas gift. This is one pf tbe items I purchased for early Christmas shopping. I tested it out using my Ipad and it has great sound quality. I just know my son is going to like it.,
B074X2LK3L,Tumyum,5.0 out of 5 stars,28-Aug,2018,This gaming headset have a great sound to the ears clear audio good bass miscrophone pretty clear and great looks also.

My kids love it.,
B074X2LK3L,Hobbit,5.0 out of 5 stars,13-Jun,2018,These are great headset for gaming. I bought this for my 10 year son who loves playing on xbox and this headset added a lot of fun to his experience. Good quality sound and he can chat with his online friends without disturbing us.,
B074X2LK3L,Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,22-Apr,2018,Son enjoyed using it has great sound could hear other players clearly and vice-versa.  Unfortunately the connection began wearing out after 2 months voices and sound began cutting in and out and now the mic does not work.  He's not abusive with his equipment as he has to buy it.  Did not want to spend a fortune on a wireless headset & this one has fairly good ratings and he chose carefully.  Not a well made set.,
B074X2LK3L,Aaron M. Holmes,5.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jan,2018,Super comfy and great headset for meeting most if not all gaming needs!Tried this headset out for hours and there wasn't any head pain no ear aches nothing but comfort great sound and an LED I could control to be on OR off instead of always on! Definitely a great purchase as a gamer!,
B074X2LK3L,Francisco,4.0 out of 5 stars,6-Jan,2018,Great sound quality for its price.  A bit bulky but very comfortable . LED lights will not work unless plugged into usb port. Wish it was a bit louder.  Other then that great headphones.,
B074X2LK3L,K. Juday,3.0 out of 5 stars,6-Apr,2018,I've bought many of these head sets and none of them seem to last long.  Always something breaking.  Gets old having to try another brand.  They all seem to be the same cheaply made breaks easily and made in different styles.,
B074X2LK3L,bill Hubbard,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-Jan,2018,Its an awesome Headset.. Nothing wrong with it at all.. Does just as good if not better then the Turtle Beach. An for a way better Price.. If your looking for a headset this one is the one to get. (If you want LED light just use a power back that u use for charging phones on the go).,
B074X2LK3L,Angela,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-Apr,2018,SUPER COOL and Comfortable headphone. The mic quality was really good.,
B074X2LK3L,Cary Roza,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Sep,2018,My grandson said he'd do any chore I asked after he received and loved this product. He's driving his older brother crazy because he can communicate on his xbox with the big boys. lol,
B074X2LK3L,KikiMochy,4.0 out of 5 stars,9-Feb,2018,"Works great with my PS4. Only thing is that every now and then I get a little bit of ""crackling"" Works fine. Just dont expect them to light up while using them on the ps4 since you can only connect the audio and not the USB",

B074X2LK3L,Peter Liu,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-Jul,2018,It is a nice headphone. I bought it for my sonand he use it to take some work with Reading Buddy software. The sound quality is good and microphone is perfect better than my old  one.,

B074X2LK3L,Laoer,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Sep,2018,My son loves this headset. They're a bit too bulky for him but they do not press hard on his ears. The headsets are also light-weighted so he can wear them for a long time. The sound quality is good.,
B074X2LK3L,dad2aaa,5.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jul,2018,My kids love them!  We have two of them and one had an issue but the seller stood behind the product and made it right by us.  Happy with the purchase and the seller.,
B074X2LK3L,GaryJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-Jan,2018,Sound is excellent. Its a perfect fit for adults and children. The microphone for online gaming works with zero issues. Bought 2 for kids xmas presents I was so impressed I ended up buying one for myself as well. Only downside is the usb plug on the end of the cord its useless for ps4 or xbox. Note: usb allows headset to light up.,
B074X2LK3L,R-Ni,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jul,2018,I ordered headphones and they really liked me. I play a lot in onlain games and with a long game headphones do not press on the ears. This is a very big plus. The sound is clean and quality. The microphone works very well. I recommend all these headphones.,
B074X2LK3L,KDOR,3.0 out of 5 stars,22-Mar,2018,Very confortable and really good sound. I do not give a 5 stars because when using it in PLAY STATION the lights do not turn on...And my son wanted a headphones with light (like the picture),

B074X2LK3L,JJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,13-Jan,2018,,
B074X2LK3L,Xun Xie,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-Jul,2018,Need to listen to music movie or video played at my lab tap in my home office. Although designed for playing games it works well for me since it does provide stereo sound with rich base and the big headset not only suppresses the surrounding noise but also it enhances the sound effect. Good product for the price. Like it.,
B074X2LK3L,DefenderOfMan,4.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jun,2018,Pros:- Great sound quality.- Fairly comfortable.- Stylish.- Durable cord.- Long cord.- Can be used on multiple platforms.Cons:- Can be uncomfortable if you wear glasses (like I do)- Cord is super long. Inconvenient for use with xbox. I don't need six feet of cord to reach from my head to the controller in my hands.- Heavy.,
B074X2LK3L,Ron,3.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jul,2018,Quality is great for the price I only have an issue with the actual cord that connects the headphones to the gaming controller. I was disappointed to find out the actually cord has to be plugged into a USB port to display the lights for PS4 usage. There is no way possible the wire can be plugged into the controller at the same time as the USB for the Sony controller Just a heads up.  Other than that sounds great and mic is decent.,
B074X2LK3L,Tina,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-May,2018,I got it for my grandson because he gets online and gets to play with his friends and he can here them better with the headset . it came on time . no problem . thank you,

B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,8-Apr,2018,High quality of listening and recording. I don't play game but I use it for karaoke apps on both cell phone and laptop. It works very well. Ear sets are comfortable too.,
B074X2LK3L,Midalys hernandez,4.0 out of 5 stars,2-May,2018,Very comfortable and clear sounds. I have had many headsets some that were more expensive that didnt sound as clear. Only issue I have is the length of cord for the HDMI plug that needs to be plugged in if you want to have the lights on. Its very short so if you want to use the light you need to either need a adapter to make it a micro usb to loop it back to plug it into the controller or a standard cell phone plug and an extension cord.,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-May,2018,This headset is amazing! But theres one drawback. On PC and Phone its nice and loud but on the PlayStation 4 you can BARELY hear anything. You may need to buy an amp of some sort or figure out an alternative to the problem but still an over all great headset. Other then the fact the LEDs are powered by a USB that's NEXT TO THE HEADPHONE JACK! It forces me to use an adapter.,
B074X2LK3L,Dale C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-Jan,2018,I love this headset! I've owned many of them (for my PS3 PS4 & for work) & for the price this is absolutely one of the best. They're comfortable fairly lightweight & sound clear.,

B074X2LK3L,AliceT,5.0 out of 5 stars,10-Sep,2018,I got this for my PS4 because I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a super nice one since I don't play that often. The quality turned out better than expected and the sound is clear and my friends can hear me very well. I think this is a great buy!,

B074X2LK3L,Allen,3.0 out of 5 stars,17-Feb,2018,Ok so I got this headset but when it opened it I realized it can only work for a mic like fore ps4 or Xbox but just for a mic but I got this to talk and just for its design but for it to actually light up you need to plug the USB into a cube and into the wall but the thing is......... the cord is really small and like  too close for comfort but it would work really good for a computer or lapto but not so much for controllers but it still works as a mic,
B074X2LK3L,Julio lopez,5.0 out of 5 stars,3-Jul,2018,they do not compare to the original ps4 wireless headset but they are extremely close to them. VERY VERY VERY CLOSE to them.,

B074X2LK3L,Ethan,5.0 out of 5 stars,19-May,2018,The design of this headset is cool. My father likes it very much. It has a main line to separate two lines. A USB. It can brighten the LED light. The other one can listen to the song and sing. It plays the music with great sound quality.,
B074X2LK3L,Jin W,4.0 out of 5 stars,10-Mar,2018,,
B074X2LK3L,Jenny,5.0 out of 5 stars,17-Feb,2018,Very good price for a gaming headset. Have used this for a couple of weeks now and it has been excellent. Volume is crystal clear no issues with the mic. Works great with my Xbox one.,
B074X2LK3L,Shizzy,4.0 out of 5 stars,13-Apr,2018,Quality sound and very comfortable my only complaint is the light up feature is only really practical if ur playing on PC otherwise u have to sit close to the console or get a portable charger with a USB port,
B074X2LK3L,DJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,9-Jul,2018,Very good budget gaming headphone. It is relative light compare to my broken Logitech wireless one and the ear pads are soft and comfortable. A good backup headphone!,

B074X2LK3L,wanghero,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Sep,2018,This is the best affordable headset you can get. The microphone is so clear it sounds like I was talking to him in the same room. The surround sound actually helps when you are in game because you can actually pick up on your objectives sound.,
B074X2LK3L,soccer mom,3.0 out of 5 stars,4-Mar,2018,I was really excited for these headphones and when I put them on they were really comfortable however as I started gaming I realized the left and right sound were switched and a month after i got them they now start buzzing every couple of minutes. Wish i would have bought a different pair,

B074X2LK3L,Joshua M. Wexler,4.0 out of 5 stars,16-Oct,2017,Once I figured out how to use these they were great! I mainly bought them for my xbox so I could actually play without my five year old running downstairs when he hears it crank up.  But for my needs the sound was excellent.  Took me a bit to realize that you plug it into the controller not the console.  This could present a problem however.  There's a USB cable as well which as far as I can tell the only thing that does is lights up teh LED lights on the headphone. I don't know why anyone would care about that.  You have them on so you can't even see them anyway.  Second my wireless controllers do not have a headphone jack so if I didn't already have a wired controller with a jack I wouldn't have been able to use this which is why i took off one star. I did plug it into the console directly but i wasn't getting any sound out of it.,

B074X2LK3L,belinda klemm,2.0 out of 5 stars,6-Mar,2018,"I bought this for my son to use with his PS4.  He likes how it looks and he says it's comfortable to wear but he was very upset that he's not able to make it light up. While this may not be a life or death situation  to a 10 year old who specifically picked these headphones for the ""cool lights"" it's a huge disappointment. Whoever designed these headphones is not the sharpest pencil in the box because the lights only come on when you plug the USB cable in. Well considering the fact that the headphone jack for the ps4 is on the controller but the USB port is on the back of the console that makes it pretty much impossible to plug the lights in.If i had known this i wouldve definitely bought a different product. I'm pretty disappointed.",

B074X2LK3L,Trevor H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,14-Nov,2017,The sound quality is good for the price range. I had a pair of $80 Turtle Beach headphones and this sounds exactly the same. The part that goes across the top of your head feels nice and soft and so are the headphones. It is a tad bulky though and will probably look stupid on smaller heads. The only downside is that you cannot connect the LED lights to a gaming console while using the headset. The cable is fairly long but it is one singular cable until the very end where it splits into the USB for the lights and the 3.5mm jack for the headset use. Each of the two cables is only about 6 inches on their own making it impossible to connect it to the console and to your controller at the same time.,

I am now happy to change this to a 5 star one XDApparently the trick is to wait 5 days get frustrated and start setting things up so that you can return them and get a new set elsewhere. Just before I finished up my discord server registered my colorful swearing and my gaming buddies wanted to know what was up how come I had been so quiet?Basically these finally decided to work and now I am more than happy with them!,

B074X2LK3L,NP,1.0 out of 5 stars,23-Mar,2018,This headset is so awful. The mic pics up every single noise that comes out of the headset leaving yourself and anyone else in your party with awful echoing feedback.,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,31-Dec,2017,Had these for 2 days before the microphone quit working . I use them with my Xbox One X .Garbage in my opinion .The 5 dollar ear buds I bought at the gas station are 100% better .,

B074X2LK3L,Vanessa Lozano,2.0 out of 5 stars,24-Jan,2018,Worked amazingly the first month or so. Lately I have been struggling with the cable near the audio jack. When the cable is moved the sound cuts out. I use this headset for my PS4 and I have 2 controllers happens on both. It keeps cutting out more every day. I treat them with lots of care and don't wrap the cable.,
B074X2LK3L,Elizabeth A.,1.0 out of 5 stars,18-Aug,2018,The cord frayed where it connects to the headset after 6 months. My son can no longer hear or talk through them.,

B074X2LK3L,Jennifer,1.0 out of 5 stars,31-Dec,2017,Every time I would use this headset my friends would complain of an echo so I don't use it. The quality is not great either and the headset is heavy and huge.,
B074X2LK3L,bridgette,2.0 out of 5 stars,3-Jan,2018,Had to return they stopped working after the 3rd day of use.,
B074X2LK3L,Beth R.,3.0 out of 5 stars,2-May,2018,This item is great at first;  sound quality fit and feel are great outstanding for the price.  The plastic feels sturdy and not like it will break easily.  The fabric around the ears doesn't feel cheap and is soft and durable.  Was used daily for a month and the week after the return window expired the microphone became faulty.  The microphone began to go in and out.  One moment would work the next it would not pick up any sound and you'd have to fiddle with the wire.  I understand you can't expect the greatest quality for such an inexpensive price but it is disappointing this product only lasts about a month.  Received this product on March 25th and began experiencing microphone issues May 1st.,
B074X2LK3L,Stephanie,2.0 out of 5 stars,11-Nov,2017,It looks nice but the headphones don't fit my head the sound is soft and hard to hear team players. Also you have to have a special plug in for your Xbox so it'll have the lights. In my opinion this headset would be 5 star worthy if I could actually hear my team mates.,
B074X2LK3L,mdougc,1.0 out of 5 stars,6-Jan,2018,I bought the Micolindun Gaming Headset to use with my Samsung Galaxy smart phone.It seemed to be a great solution for making calls and listening to music in a high noise area.But it doesn't work with the phone.I plug the headset into the phone and there is no sound.  It does not work.Ear buds work with the phone ok.  And the headset works on my laptop.There seems to be no way to contact the seller.This is false advertising.Does anyone know a headset that works with a phone?  I intend to return this junk.,
B074X2LK3L,Justin Kyle,2.0 out of 5 stars,20-Jan,2018,Mic stopped working... very disappointed.,

B074X2LK3L,Edvaldo oliveira,2.0 out of 5 stars,16-Oct,2018,The pin that fits in the video game is very sensitive and too much breakage has to improve the quality because this is the second headset that I buy from it. Thank you,
B074X2LK3L,Para Normal,1.0 out of 5 stars,7-Apr,2018,Didn't work had to send it back,
B074X2LK3L,Angie,1.0 out of 5 stars,26-Feb,2018,My son loves these the only thing I don't like about them is that there's a little tiny short cord that must be plugged in in order for the lights to be on. So my son doesn't use the lights. I wouldn't have chosen these if I had known that. But overall they're great headphonesWe've had these for 6 months now and they no longer work. Very disappointing!!!!!!!,
B074X2LK3L,krista Schnurr,1.0 out of 5 stars,7-May,2018,Stopped working after 5 months. Now what???,
B074X2LK3L,Anonymous,1.0 out of 5 stars,22-Apr,2018,Headphones are okay but this set is cheaply made. Within the first month or so the jack broke off into the controller. Very disappointed kid!,

B074X2LK3L,Jennifer,1.0 out of 5 stars,20-May,2018,Broke quickly.  My son can hear but not talk.  Sucks he spent his money on this.,
B074X2LK3L,Tiffany Blakely,1.0 out of 5 stars,14-Jun,2018,I had issues with after about a month. I would have to push down the volume wheel to get sound out of the right ear. Complete garbage I wasted my money. Defenitly the worse hedset I have ever owned. Im never buying a hunterspider product again. RIG & Turtle Beach are so much better.,

B074X2LK3L,Sandra,1.0 out of 5 stars,20-Feb,2018,The mic doesn'gt work. I didn't have the time to return the headset and lost the box to return it eventually. It's a shame. Especially since I spent $30! Its cheap as well. Might as well spend an extra $20 and buy turtle beaches,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,17-Feb,2018,,
B074X2LK3L,reader,1.0 out of 5 stars,21-Mar,2018,I bought the headphones on February 5th and the microphone is broken less than a month later.  There is no guarantee on the headphones so I do not recommend.I do not recommend these headphones.,

B074X2LK3L,lambie,1.0 out of 5 stars,27-May,2018,I bought this microphone for my 11 year old son to play Fortnite on xbox.  He was so excited when I bought them for him.  The microphone worked for a couple of weeks and stopped working.  I contacted the seller to get a refund or new pair and never received any response.,
B074X2LK3L,Alice Lee,5.0 out of 5 stars,6-Oct,2017,This is the best headset I've used. There are replaceable plugs in the package so you don't worry if there is something wrong with the plug during the game. Besides I love the diamond blue and the design is really cool. All my friends praise it. Furthermore it is the best headset that I've had for its excellent tone quality which would make you feel in the immediate scene of the game. I like it. Since I had it I want to use my former ones any longer.,
B074X2LK3L,Tee LInk,1.0 out of 5 stars,20-Aug,2018,The cord lasted for about two months and it started to decay 20 days before it finally snapped.,
B074X2LK3L,WidebodyM3,2.0 out of 5 stars,30-Jun,2018,I bought this headset for my son to use with his Xbox One. After about a month only 1 side of the headset was working and the mic also stopped working. There were no visible signs of a frayed wire or jack plug being bent. I contacted the seller and they were absolutely great!(thats the only reason why I gave it an extra star. They shipped out a new pair within days. About 1 week later the SAME issue happened to the new headset. With that being said I can not recommend these to anyone. When it did work my son really liked them though. Just a shame that its of very poor quality/reliability.,
B074X2LK3L,Andrew,2.0 out of 5 stars,12-May,2018,This headset wasn't to bad at first. I bought this to use with my xbox one and I soon as I received it you could tell it was made primarily for pc use. I may have missed this in the description but when plugged into your controller their is an extreme excess amount of cable that you must rest on your lap or leave hanging about 6 inches from the controller. This may of been a bit annoying but something I could deal with.The real issue started about 2 weeks after use. It began to develop a short in the wire by the volume control so that you could only hear game volume in one ear. I do not believe it was from rough use as I am always gentle with all of my console items. (Still use my xbox one day one edition controller) the sound goes in and out on the right ear which seems like it's only a matter of time before it goes out completely. For this sadly only a 2 star review from me.,
B074X2LK3L,J,1.0 out of 5 stars,14-Jun,2018,shorts out regularly only can hear through one ear.,
B074X2LK3L,Milan Thakkar,1.0 out of 5 stars,8-Jul,2018,Lasted one month and does not work any longer. Garbage quality. Do not buy. Now the return window is closed. I am a Youtuber. I will make sure I do a video about it,
B074X2LK3L,Dock,1.0 out of 5 stars,16-May,2018,This device is garbage. It stopped working after 10 total hours of use.....I'd give it zero stars if I could. Want my money back.,

B074X2LK3L,Luis Coustasse,1.0 out of 5 stars,30-May,2018,Really nice the lights and everything but it lasts only one month after a month the mic stopped working and the USB unfortunately is only for the lights not for the audio or mic. Now not even the earphone work.,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,10-May,2018,Product did not work well. Could hear fine but inline switch was cheap and mic would work then not work. I went bought Turtle Beach to replace. They work way better and are more comfortable.,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,6-Jul,2018,,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,19-Jun,2017,This a great product that is well worth your money. For the price of the headset the sound quality is excellent and the mic quality is even better. If your looking for cheap but high quality headset get this.,
B074X2LK3L,Tasha,1.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jan,2018,The mouth pice is to short one would have to scream in order for the other to hear you.,
B074X2LK3L,discouraged,2.0 out of 5 stars,10-Aug,2018,Purchased headset in March they sounded good but the connection line to controller does not hold up.  In less than 3 months the mic stopped working and a week later the sound stopped also.,
B074X2LK3L,Angel Grullon,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-Nov,2017,bought it for my son. He loves it.,
B074X2LK3L,B&N Home,3.0 out of 5 stars,10-Dec,2017,"Sound quality is good headset is a little bulky but very light and comfortable for its size unfortunately I am having to return because the mic is not working I have tried several means of getting it to work with no luck. Also if you are expecting to be able to plug the usb in to power the light when you are attempting to use on a console you will need a usb extension cable because the 3.5mm plugs into the controller and the usb is connected to the same cord whip about 6"" away.",
B074X2LK3L,Barton Iver,1.0 out of 5 stars,16-Oct,2018,This has got to be the WORST purchase Ive made in years. Don't waste your money. Microphone stopped working first time.,

B074X2LK3L,Horton Gladys,1.0 out of 5 stars,17-Oct,2018,I bought this item knowing it is cheap and didn't expect much quality from it. But this thing didn't last 2 weeks!,
B074X2LK3L,Chandler Beryl,1.0 out of 5 stars,17-Oct,2018,This product is awful. Do not buy it. I had to have my product replaced and then it broke again after two weeks of use.,
B074X2LK3L,Tyler,1.0 out of 5 stars,18-Jul,2018,After about a month of use the right side just stopped working for no reason. And after that when i was playing with my friends the microphone would randomly stop working for no reason and I'd have to screw with it to just get the microphone to work. And about a week or so ago I went to pick up my controller while it was plugged into my controller and the plug broke off inside of the controller. The plug was not bent or damaged in any way it just broke off from me picking it up. I wouldn't reccomend.,
B074X2LK3L,jteeps,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Mar,2018,My grandson is having a blast.  Great fast shipping and so far quality. I also purchased the replacement warranty for this one and two others.  Grandchildren are very happy,
B074X2LK3L,Dallin R,2.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jul,2018,Update: after a couple months of use these headphones are almost useless. When I am in a chat with teammates my headset makes them echo to the point where they ask me to mute my mic. They can often times also hear my gameplay through the chat while my mic is unmuted and my tv is all the way down.Decent sound with pretty good bass but they are bulky and the left headphone connection clicks when I wiggle it. The lighting feature is cool but you will have to have a usb power source to plug into and the cord is really short so it probably will only work well on PC.I tested this on Xbox.,
B074X2LK3L,Stacey Eberhard,3.0 out of 5 stars,1-Aug,2018,For the xbox one I have 2 controllers with no 3.5 mm jack and one with a 3.5 mm jack just wanted to know if there were two different types of controllers with holes because I got the updated controller awhile back and wanted to know if there was another one that came out with a jack.,
B074X2LK3L,Eric Sotag,5.0 out of 5 stars,15-Sep,2018,Great product and price,
B074X2LK3L,Sheng W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Oct,2017,Very nice and beautiful headset. I buy this to replace my old headset. It is very comfortable. And the blue lights on both side and the microphone are so cool.,
B074X2LK3L,Brittany Standridge,4.0 out of 5 stars,13-Mar,2018,Sounds is clear Mic works great I was sceptical to buy because I usually only use turtle beach products but have found that I like this head set more then my old turtle beach head set only down side is that the Mic can't be used on either side of your head and only goes in the left would recommend to anyone and can't beat the price.,
B074X2LK3L,Stephanie O.,4.0 out of 5 stars,21-Aug,2018,Great product for the price. Better than average sound quality for gaming. No complaints. My grandson is murder on headsets of all kinds and this one has held up beautifully to his abuse. Actually that was the only surprise in this package.,
B074X2LK3L,Dale B,1.0 out of 5 stars,12-Jan,2018,,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,28-Jul,2018,The headset itself was great for its price and according to my friends the mic was great but the connection from  usb and the other cable are tiedTogether skits hard to have the lights on and have it connected to the controller at the same time,
B074X2LK3L,michael fleming,1.0 out of 5 stars,13-Nov,2017,They r huge,
B074X2LK3L,Kathy KellyGeorge,3.0 out of 5 stars,14-Mar,2018,Microphone shorted out after a week. They look great & my daughter likes the feel & sound quality. Fortunately she has another mic she can use when online with her friends.,

B074X2LK3L,B. Morello,1.0 out of 5 stars,22-Aug,2018,This is the third one of these headsets we purchased.  The first we returned and thought it was a fluke then I purchased two more for my boys for their Xbox gaming systems.  They worked fine for the first few months but last month my other son's headset broke and now this headset broke.  I would not recommend buying this for the amount of money you spend and we only got 3 months use out of them.,
B074X2LK3L,Javier Carreno,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Feb,2018,this is a great headset.  the sound is clear and is very comfertable.  it is almost as good as the beats solo hd wired headset.  would recomend to anybody.,

B074X2LK3L,Amy Brown Champion,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-Dec,2017,These were a hit with my 14 year old!,
B074X2LK3L,Joel Lee,2.0 out of 5 stars,29-Jun,2018,First off the headphones are pretty heavy in itself. I got used to it after about an hour but for anyone who doesn't like heavy headphones I wouldn't recommend this. On top of that the microphone feeds in from audio from the headphones so my friends can hear things on my end that isn't my voice. Furthermorethe plug is super sensitive so even nudging it a little bit would take it out so the mic would stop working even though the sound feeds into the headphones which is another problem the mic would stop working even when sound feeds in so my friends can't tell whether i'm in the call or not. Sound quality is ok for its price so thats the only reason these headphones aren't one star,
B074X2LK3L,Noah,2.0 out of 5 stars,5-Feb,2018,This headset is not bad quality but they really shouldn't advertise it for Xbox use because it 100% does not work. I tried it with my phone my laptop and both my parents' phones and it is not defective just not compatible with any Xbox controller. I really needed a headset because my old one broke and this was disappointing to say the least.,
B074X2LK3L,Lola Falana,2.0 out of 5 stars,6-Feb,2018,Got it for my son. It does not light up. Had it for a month. He says it doesn't work well anymore. He does abuse things. But that's what some 9-year-olds do.,
B074X2LK3L,Amanda J,4.0 out of 5 stars,20-Jul,2018,My son uses this headset for his PS4. He loves it but we are having an issue with it lighting up properly. It doesn't effect the functionality of the headset though.,
B074X2LK3L,David C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,22-Mar,2018,The microphone broke after 20 days so I would not recommend.,
B074X2LK3L,Lolita Cantu,5.0 out of 5 stars,11-Aug,2018,Soft around the ears and perfect sound!,

B074X2LK3L,Jenn,1.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jul,2018,We received this on a Monday and by Thursday evening the mic was no longer functional. The sellers troubleshooting suggestions did nothing to improve functionality. It was a nice looking headset and comfortable. But unfortunately neither of those matter if it doesn't work properly after only 3 days or normal use.,
B074X2LK3L,Oaklejm,1.0 out of 5 stars,25-Mar,2018,I got this as a Christmas present.  It lasted all of 2.5 months before the right ear speaker stopped working.  Hard to play games with only hearing one side of the audio.,

B074X2LK3L,Michelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,22-Apr,2018,These were great at first but within a short time the cord has a short in it. Now if it moves even a little in the plugs it stops working either in the headset or the mic. Disappointed because I liked these a lot to begin with.,

B074X2LK3L,Ethan,1.0 out of 5 stars,12-Jan,2018,Issue after issue getting it to work on PC with Windows 10. Interference that causes ear shattering static at random. Will work for a bit then destroy my eardrums. WTF. Terrible buy for PC.  May work with consoles but have never tested.,

B074X2LK3L,RCH,1.0 out of 5 stars,8-Mar,2018,"I was so excited to receive this headset after I purchased it.  That was until I realized that it doesn't work with my XBOX ONE - X.  I hear there is an ""adapter"" floating around for this headset that makes it compatible with the Xbox One-X but until I understand how to purchase it I'm forced to give it one star.  A complete waste of my money.",
B074X2LK3L,Beach Bum ,2.0 out of 5 stars,26-Mar,2018,"Low rating due to the fact I bought for my son to use with ps4. He was stoked when I told him they would light up.... they due but the b**** is it has seperate plug for lights.

They are completely useless.,

This is the second headset to fail in less than a year. Wish there was a way to return defective headsets. At this rate I'm going to wind up spending more money on headsets than I paid for the xbox one.,
B074X2LK3L,FrozenOne,2.0 out of 5 stars,17-Aug,2018,We really enjoyed this headset for the 6 months that they worked. Unfortunately after 6 months of moderate use the sound stopped working on one side of the set.,

B074X2LK3L,joie _de_vivre,2.0 out of 5 stars,21-Jun,2018,The headphones fell apart after a couple months of normal use. My son was taking the headphones off of his head and the headphones split into two pieces. The internal wire was pulled out so the headphones no longer function properly,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,11-May,2018,Works great for pubg mobile. Only problem i have with them is it came in large and i got a relatively small head. So they do slide around. Have to put on a hat to use them without getting neck cramps due to weird angles during intense fights with them sliding off. But other than that no complaints. Mic does pick up background noise pretty easily. Noise cancellation works great on them. When im talking ingame with them i can barely even hear the words coming out if my mouth. Mic is fully adjustable/angleable.,

B074X2LK3L,Daryn,3.0 out of 5 stars,11-Dec,2017,I previously owned a pair of Sades SA930 and SA810 headphones and much of this review will be in a comparison to them. Neither pair lasted 6 months. Eventually the Mute switch died then the audio would get patchy or the mic went out. I went with a different brand hoping to get better quality.The SA930 are a bit smaller than the SA810 but otherwise identical.The GoodThe Headset is light and doesn't weigh the head down after using it for a few hours.The Mic head is connected on a flexible band so you can adjust it into the perfect spot.The Mic arm is on a swivel so you can move it out of the way.The cable is super long over 6 feet.The cable has a hook and loop wrap on it so you can keep the unused portion neatly bunched up.The cable has a nice woven cover that feels like quality.There is a volume adjustment and mute button on the cord.The USB connector is for lights only and is connected pretty close to the plug so it doesn't get in the way when not in use.The Bad:It's just not comfortable.Had I worn these before the SA810 they would have rated 3 maybe 4 stars in comfort but really they pale in comparison. So much so that I am going to return them and get another pair of SA810 this time with a Warranty.The top cushion is nice but it is too firm for how light the headset is and so it just acts as a big buffer and is less comfortable than a wider flatter style.The material of the ear cushions don't breathe so my head gets sweaty after wearing them for a while.The ear cushions are too big or the ear cavities are too small either way they are not 'over the ear' so my ears get cramped. I don't feel it while wearing them but after a couple of hours I take them off and my ears just hurt and ache.The plug jacket it too wide so I can't plug them into my phone with it's current case. If I were going to keep them I would have to shave some plastic off.People I have talked to said I am not as clear. Not bad but not as clear as I used to be when speaking.,

B074X2LK3L,momserf2,1.0 out of 5 stars,26-Jul,2018,Not worth it at all,
B074X2LK3L,David Coleman,1.0 out of 5 stars,30-Jan,2018,Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.,
B074X2LK3L,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,29-Jul,2018,Trash! From now on I'm buying the $16 ones that I though were poorly made.  These weren't great to begin with (hardly noise cancellation noise muffling at best) sound quality not great either and they broke within a few days of use.  Everything is distorted now.  Tested on multiple consoles they're trash.,

B074X2LK3L,Lee Hinton,4.0 out of 5 stars,23-Sep,2018,Mic picks up everything in the background and it gets kinda iffy sound quality wise when there's a lot of bass and they can feel obnoxiously bulky at times. That being said they're fantastic for the price and durable. I've dropped them several times on tile without consequence I think they would be great for a younger gamer or a casual player.,

B074X2LK3L,Denis Isenburg,4.0 out of 5 stars,2-Oct,2018,Great sound on my Xbox and it is nice to be able to talk to others. The only down is that I need a USB extension cable because the audio plugs into the gaming controller and the USB cable for power plus into the Xbox but the cables are both only about 6 inches long at the split.,
B074X2LK3L,Y.Li,5.0 out of 5 stars,1-Oct,2018,This headset has great quality. Very clear sound. Fashionable cool design especially it could light up.The There provided mic could be folded down or up convenient enough. Very happy with the purchase.,

B074X2LK3L,Dawn Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,16-Oct,2018,I originally bought this headset for the kids to use while gaming until my husband seen them. I had to give them to him. He uses them to game and on his computer. They work good and look good. Have good sound and wasn't expensive like most with this quality.,

B074X2LK3L,Beth Villanueva,3.0 out of 5 stars,26-Oct,2018,When I first tried on the headset it automatically started to cut off. Every movement I did the headset would just not work. Now I have to play without moving so much or else it just stops working.,
B074X2LK3L,alsalami70,5.0 out of 5 stars,4-Jun,2018,It is very good gaming headset! I like it.This is very useful and handy headset working good and very clear voice and comfortable on ears.The quality is good.The price is acceptable.I recommend.,

B074X2LK3L,Mario Leal,5.0 out of 5 stars,31-Oct,2018,They're not turtle beaches but for the price they outdid what I expected for my money. My little brother loves them and if he breaks them which he's done before it's not a bad blow to you wallet.,
B074X2LK3L,Thompson Thomasina,1.0 out of 5 stars,15-Oct,2018,After 1 month of use the headset has failed and the microphone does not work.,
B074X2LK3L,Donald Erckert,4.0 out of 5 stars,20-Oct,2018,Just as the headline says the sound is great quality as well as the comfort of the headset.  The ability to light it up is not very functional.  I would either need some sort of extension cord for the USB or they need to change it so that it connects to the controller or PlayStation.  The plug fit fine initially but after a few months doesn't seem to fit properly anymore and has seemed to always have had intermittent sound issues that required wiggling the cord.  That was for the blue one.  The red one (same brand and bought the same time) seems to not have a problem fitting into the jack like the blue one but also has intermittent sound problems.,
B074X2LK3L,Emmanuel Ekpo,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Oct,2018,I love these headphones,
B074X2LK3L,brandy rose,4.0 out of 5 stars,16-Oct,2018,I enjoy the headset it has good sound quality and my voice goes through the mic flawlessly but I'm kinda disappointed the lights only work if you use it on computer,
B074X2LK3L,Heather,1.0 out of 5 stars,30-Oct,2018,This will only work with one of my sons Xbox 1 controllers. He has 2 of the exact same controllers yet it will only work with one. It stops working periodically for no reason. Also the only way to get the headset to light up is if you sit at the gaming system and plug into it directly. It will not light up just plugging into the controller.,
B074X2LK3L,Stacy,5.0 out of 5 stars,28-Oct,2018,Yeah the headphone is good. Iike it very much. The sounds are amazing and it feel like durable. Wearing that gaming makes me feel like pro.  May recommend my friends purchase that if they asked so. The price is lower than the market. But the quality is higher than I expected.,

B074X2LK3L,Lauren Quintanilla,4.0 out of 5 stars,14-Oct,2018,I love how big it is and how well i can hear with it but i do think the whole thing was misleading. It doesnt work well with new xbox one controllers but it works fine with my old controller and the ps4 controllers.,

B074X2LK3L,Brooks Lindsey,5.0 out of 5 stars,7-Feb,2018,Pretty much the best you can buy for the money. Very comfortable well built not too tight but secure enough to be comfortable. The mic is clear and the speakers are good. I use these every day for pretty much everything but music mostly meetings. Has a nice braided cord and the inline volume and mic controls are really nice. The only complaint is that the LED lights on the side can be seen out of the corner of my eyes and can be distracting but you can just unplug the USB and they're off so no big deal.,

B074X2LK3L,Xinlin,4.0 out of 5 stars,8-Oct,2018,These headphones have great sound quality and the microphone quality is also very good. A huge plus is the cushioning it's very comfortable and it's ideal for prolonged sessions where you may need to use them. The small volume control bar on the cord includes a mute switch for the microphone. The cords plug directly into the audio output and input jacks on your computer. The light up function is powered through a USB plug. Definitely recommend.,
